0,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963480,health,"Veterans who have sustained a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) show signs of premature cognitive decline that are comparable to those in patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD), new research shows.

Investigators studied age- and IQ-matched veterans with and without mTBI, nonveteran healthy controls, and IQ-matched patients with early-stage PD and no dementia and found those with mTBI performed significantly worse than matched controls on several cognitive tests, particularly those measuring cognitive flexibility. In addition, their performance on those tests was similar to that of the early-stage participants with PD.

""We found that our young veterans with mild TBI had subtle but significant problems with cognition that were strikingly similar to those seen in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease,"" lead author Vicki Nejtek, PhD, associate professor of pharmacology and neuroscience, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, told Medscape Medical News.

""The application here is tremendous, because if this type of cognitive decline can be detected, why not go ahead and capitalize on that knowledge and implement lifestyle changes and nonpharmacologic changes that can help the brain compensate for whatever losses in neurodegeneration for what might have occurred as a result of the mTBI?"" she said.

The study was published online November 17 in PLoS One.

Residual Cognitive Problems

More than 82% of head injuries sustained by active-duty members of the military are classified as mTBI, the investigators note. A significant proportion of these individuals experience ""residual cognitive problems"" that are evident 1-10 years post-injury.

Two recent epidemiologic studies showed a 56% increased risk of PD in veterans with mild TBI within 12 years following the injury. ""But while residual cognitive difficulties may suggest mTBI-related risk for PD, there is little, if any, prospective evidence to characterize the earliest cognitive manifestations of mTBI in a young group of individuals that might resemble those with PD,"" said Nejtek.

Additionally, ""we know that there is likely some cognitive impairment that precedes PD, but we haven't known what the very specific cognitive domains were that impacted that risk,"" she said.

To investigate, the researchers compared the cognitive scores of veterans who had sustained an mTBI with veterans without mTBI, healthy nonveteran controls, (age 25-45 years) and older, early-stage, nondemented individuals with PD (age 60-90 years).

Participants underwent screening to rule out severe brain injury, and all subjects completed the Mini Neuropsychological Interview to screen for serious mood disorders, the 17-item PTSD Checklist (PCL), and the Geriatric Depression Scale-30 (GDS).

Of the 200 volunteers who gave consent and were screened, 114 were included in the analysis (25 female, 70 non-Hispanic White, 29 Hispanic, 15 Black).

Subjects (n) Mean (SD) age (years) Veterans with mTBI (27) 33.4 (5.5) Veterans without mTBI (30) 32.7 (3.8) Healthy controls (30) 31 (4.9) Early-stage PD (27) 68.5 (8.3)

There were no significant differences between all 4 groups in IQ, gender, or race/ethnicity.

All mTBIs were ""non-penetrating injuries"" that had occurred within the past 7 years. Most (n = 13) were grade 1 concussions, based on the BAT-L grading criteria, followed by grade 2 (n = 19) and grade 3 (n = 4).

None of the groups met criteria for depression and PTSD, based on PCL and GDS scores.

""Totally Unexpected""

There were notable differences between the groups in cognitive tests (F [21, 299] = 3.09, P < .0005; Wilks' λ = .569, partial η2 = .172). Veterans with mTBI ""performed more similarly to PD subjects than their matched controls and also performed as if they were decades older, according to the normative data,"" the authors report.

The tests showing significant differences were the Trail-making Tests (TMT-A and TMT-B); the CLOX tests (1 and 2), which measure visuospatial memory; and the Animal Naming test.

Veterans with mTBI took ""significantly longer"" to complete both TMT tests, compared to veterans without mTBI (TMT-A: P = .007; TMT-B: P = .013), and to healthy controls (TMT-A: P = .014; TMT-B: P = .006). In fact, for TMT-B results, the veterans with mTBI took 26.5 to 28.8 seconds longer to complete, compared with age- and IQ-matched veterans and healthy controls, respectively.

When the researchers compared the performance of these veterans to standardized normative mean scores from the general population, they found ""totally unexpected"" results — ie, ""the extent of decline observed with TMT-raw mean scores that corresponded to <10th percentile, indicating below average cognitive functioning in veterans with mTBI with response times of 11.2 seconds longer than their age- and education normative mean,"" they report.

No statistical differences were found between veterans with mTBI and the PD group for both TMT-A and TMT-B tests (P = .749 and P = .140, respectively), ""suggesting that these groups performed similarly on tests measuring cognitive flexibility, attention, processing speed, and memory,"" the investigators add.

The only significant difference found in CLOX 2 scores was between veterans with mTBI and healthy controls (P = .049), and the only significant difference in Animal Naming was also between veterans with mTBI and healthy controls, (P = .015), although the veterans with mTBI recalled fewer animals, compared with the other groups.

The study did not show global cognitive decline, only decline in a few domains, Nejtek noted, ""but premature decline in domains of cognitive flexibility and attention and the ability to process information can have a huge impact on daily living, and can impact relationships, professional, and personal life.""

She advised clinicians to ask all patients whether they have a history of a head injury and, if so, she recommended neurocognitive testing. If these tests reveal cognitive issues, she recommended implementing lifestyle changes and nonpharmacologic interventions.

Lasting Effects

Commenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, Michael Alosco, PhD, associate professor of neurology and co-director, Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Center Clinical Core, Boston, Massachusetts, said it ""adds to the literature showing lasting cognitive problems from TBI in veteran populations.""

However, he added, ""importantly, the causes of these cognitive problems aren't clear and are likely multifactorial that include and extend beyond reasons associated with TBI,"" said Alosco, an investigator at the Boston University CTE Center, who was not involved with the study.

""There continues to be evidence that TBI has lasting effects and, although this association is likely to be dependent on severity and frequency and other factors, it is critical to conduct careful assessments of TBI, particularly in high-risk populations like veterans, and integrate such history into care coordination.""

Nejtek added that their group is looking at serum biomarkers to ""to map onto the cognitive problems we found to see if we can identify a phenotype that could be more easily recognized in the clinic.""

1,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963473,health,"Patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) remained in remission longer when they took secukinumab (Cosentyx) during a 6-month–long taper of glucocorticoids, a monoclonal antibody drug that inhibits interleukin-17A, compared with placebo, according to phase 2 trial results presented at the virtual annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology.

The mainstay of GCA treatment is glucocorticoids, although IL-6 inhibition with tocilizumab (Actemra) has recently become another option, Jens Thiel, MD, vice director of the Clinic for Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology at University Hospital Freiburg (Germany), told attendees.

Dr Christopher Palma

""Secukinumab has shown significant improvements in the signs and symptoms of IL-17A-driven medical conditions such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and it has a very favorable long-term safety profile,"" Thiel said. ""There is experimental and preclinical data that points toward the role of IL-17A in the pathogenesis of giant cell arteritis, and therefore IL-17A inhibition, blocking vascular inflammation, is potentially a new therapeutic target for GCA.""

Christopher R. Palma, MD, ScM, assistant professor in the division of allergy, immunology, and rheumatology at the University of Rochester (N.Y.), said in an interview that the trial's preliminary findings were exciting because they suggest that IL-17A is likely to be an effective strategy for treating GCA. ""This aligns with known pathophysiology of GCA, where IL-17A is an important part of pathology of disease,"" Palma said.

In the randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, researchers enrolled 52 patients, all at least 50 years old, who had never taken a biologic for GCA. Most of the participants (80.8%) had new-onset GCA, diagnosed within the previous 6 weeks, and 19.2% had relapsing GCA. The participants received either 300 mg of secukinumab or placebo every week for 5 weeks, and then every 4 weeks for 48 total weeks. At baseline, all participants also began a 26-week taper of prednisolone from a dose of 25-60 mg/day at baseline to 0 at week 27. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants in sustained remission through week 28.

Among the 27 participants taking secukinumab and the 25 taking placebo, 37 completed the study treatment (71%). At week 28, those still in remission included 70.1% of participants taking secukinumab and 20.3% of those taking placebo (odds ratio [OR], 9.3). Through week 52, the proportion of participants in remission included 59.3% of the secukinumab group and 8% of the placebo group.

Determination of flare was based on signs and symptoms along with a C-reactive protein level of more than 10 mg/L or an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Thiel did not provide more details on these parameters or on how flares were determined, but reported that participants taking secukinumab did not reach a median time to first flare, compared to a median 197 days in the placebo group.

All the participants taking secukinumab and 96% of those taking placebo experienced treatment-emergent adverse events, with serious adverse events occurring in 22.2% of those taking secukinumab and 44% of those taking placebo. Two patients in each group discontinued the treatment because of adverse events, and one participant in each group died from causes determined to be unrelated to the treatment.

The trial's effect size was large, but Palma noted that the study's generalizability is limited by prednisolone tapering in the placebo arm because that's not reflective of most clinical practice for treatment of GCA.

""We would be unlikely to mimic this trial design as we know rates of disease flare and recurrence are high without long-term therapy of some kind,"" Palma said. ""The real challenge will be in assessing relative benefit and risk among many possible therapies and how IL-17A–directed therapies fit in. Obviously, a head-to-head trial design would help answer many of these questions.""

Palma said it's too early to recommend widespread off-label use of secukinumab for GCA, but he would encourage his patients with GCA to consider participating in a phase 3 trial of the drug.

Novartis, which markets secukinumab, funded the research. Thiel has received speaking and/or advising fees from AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, and Novartis, and research grants from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Novartis. His coauthors had disclosures for a wide range of pharmaceutical companies. Palma has received research funding from AbbVie, Incyte, and Regeneron.

2,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963399,health,"(Reuters) - Dangerous blood clots often seen in patients with COVID-19 happen at least in part because the spike on the virus attaches itself to molecules in the blood that play key roles in preventing clotting, thereby inactivating them, new research shows.

With the virus bound to them, ""these molecules (heparan sulfate/heparin) can't do their usual anticoagulant activities,"" explained Jingyu Yan of the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics in China.

Blood clots associated with COVID-19 often damage the lungs and other organs and can cause heart attacks and strokes. The excessive clotting has been attributed to the high levels of inflammation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has not been clear until now that the virus itself also has a direct effect, Yan's team reported in the International Journal of Biological Macromolecules.

Fortunately, they point out, the now common practice of giving COVID-19 patients blood-thinning drugs can ""significantly reduce"" the clotting caused by the virus.

3,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963373,health,"SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - Prosecutors rested their criminal fraud case against Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes on Friday, but it was still unclear whether the former Silicon Valley executive who once promised to revolutionize the blood testing industry would testify in her own defense.

Over the course of the two-month trial, jurors in San Jose, California, have heard testimony from more than two dozen witnesses, including patients and investors whom prosecutors say Holmes deceived. At the close of their case, prosecutors moved to dismiss one count of fraud regarding a patient.

Now, Holmes will have the opportunity to present witnesses in her own defense, though she is not obligated to.

Holmes is accused of making false claims about Theranos, including that its devices could run a range of tests more quickly and accurately than conventional laboratory means from a drop of blood from a finger prick.

Once touted as the Steve Jobs of biotech for her company's supposedly innovative technology, Holmes faces nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy. She has pleaded not guilty.

Founded by Holmes at the age of 19 in 2003, Theranos garnered attention from private investors and was once valued at $9 billion.

Its fortunes waned after the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles starting in 2015 that suggested the Theranos devices were flawed and inaccurate."
4,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963470,health,"Women with a history of stage III to stage IV breast cancer had significantly more pathologic vertebral fractures compared to those with stage I and stage II disease, based on data from approximately 5,000 adult women.

Breast cancer remains associated with increased fracture risk in part because of estrogen deficiency, aromatase inhibitors, frailty, and skeletal metastases, wrote Joan C. Lo, MD, of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, and colleagues. Fractures associated with these factors have been studied, but many of the existing epidemiologic studies lack detail on fractures related to cancer, they noted. The researchers examined the association between pathologic fractures and major osteoporotic fractures in women with invasive breast cancer who received endocrine therapy.

In a study published in JAMA Network Open (2021 Nov 18. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.33861), the researchers reviewed data from 5,010 women enrolled in the Pathways Study (3,312 women) or Research Program on Genes, Environment, and Health (RPGEH) study (1,698 women) with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer who received endocrine therapy. The women were followed for up to 10 years for incident fracture, with a median follow-up period of 6.7 years.

The average age of the women was 60.2 years; 73.3% were non-Hispanic White, 4.9% were Black, 9.4% were Hispanic, and 1.6% were women whose ethnicity was unknown. Approximately 90% of the women were at stage I to stage II at initial diagnosis.

Overall, 340 (6.8%) had incident fractures during the follow-up period. The incident fractures included 46 hip, 104 vertebral, 78 humerus, and 137 wrist fractures. Significantly more women with hip fracture (43.5%) were age 80 years or older, compared with less than 25% of women with vertebral fractures (22.1%), humerus (19.2%), or wrist fracture (15.3%).

Pathologic fractures accounted for 22 of 104 incident vertebral fractures (21.2%) and fewer than 5 of 46 incident hip fractures (8.7%); few wrist and humerus fractures were pathologic. According to tumor stage, 15 of 87 (17.2%) vertebral fractures in women with initial stage I and II were pathologic, compared to 7 of 17 (41.2%) in women with initial stage III to stage IV breast cancer (P < .05).

The results emphasized the need to consider vertebral fracture risk in women with breast cancer, notably advanced stage cancer, as approximately one-third of the incident vertebral fractures in this subset of patients was deemed cancer-related, the researchers noted.

""As the axial skeleton is a common site for breast cancer metastasis and vertebrae a common site for pathologic fracture, primary care physicians should consider the possibility of pathologic fracture in women with higher risk based on advanced-stage cancer history,"" the researchers wrote.

The study findings were limited by several factors, including the lack of data on fracture risk factors, treatment, and chemotherapy, and the inclusion only of clinically diagnosed fractures and not asymptomatic vertebral fractures, the researchers noted. However, the results were strengthened by the large sample size and comprehensive fracture assessment, they said. Additional studies to examine nonpathologic fracture risk according to breast cancer treatment, such as the use of aromatase inhibitors versus cytotoxic chemotherapy, may inform which women would benefit from more aggressive osteoporotic fracture prevention, they concluded.

Findings Inform Shared Decision-Making

""This study highlights the apparent association between an initial diagnosis of stage III or IV breast cancer and an increased risk for pathologic vertebral fracture,"" said Constance Bohon, MD, a gynecologist in private practice in Washington, D.C., in an interview. ""Most likely this finding is secondary to breast cancer metastases,"" Bohon noted. However, she questioned whether there is a difference in fracture rates between women who received only aromatase inhibitors, those who received tamoxifen, and those who received both treatments.

""Additional data to determine the age of menopause, exercise frequency, current weight, and family history of osteoporosis may serve to identify those at highest risk for pathologic vertebral fracture,"" said Bohon. ""Until further data are available, clinicians should review this study and counsel their patients regarding options to potentially mitigate their apparent increased risk for pathologic vertebral fracture,"" she emphasized.

The study was supported by the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, and the Research Program on Genes, Environment, and Health of Kaiser Permanente Northern California. The researchers had no financial conflicts to disclose. Bohon had no financial conflicts to disclose but serves on the Editorial Advisory Board of Ob.Gyn. News.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Republicans fighting President Joe Biden's coronavirus vaccine mandates are wielding a new weapon against the White House rules: natural immunity.

They contend that people who have recovered from the virus have enough immunity and antibodies to not need COVID-19 vaccines, and the concept has been invoked by Republicans as a sort of stand-in for vaccines.

Florida wrote natural immunity into state law this week as GOP lawmakers elsewhere are pushing similar measures to sidestep vaccine mandates. Lawsuits over the mandates have also begun leaning on the idea. Conservative federal lawmakers have implored regulators to consider it when formulating mandates.

Scientists acknowledge that people previously infected with COVID-19 have some level of immunity but that vaccines offer a more consistent level of protection. Natural immunity is also far from a one-size-fits-all scenario, making it complicated to enact sweeping exemptions to vaccines.

That's because how much immunity COVID-19 survivors have depends on how long ago they were infected, how sick they were, and if the virus variant they had is different from mutants circulating now. For example, a person who had a minor case one year ago is much different than a person who had a severe case over the summer when the delta variant was raging through the country. It's also difficult to reliably test whether someone is protected from future infections.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in August that COVID-19 survivors who ignored advice to get vaccinated were more than twice as likely to get infected again. A more recent study from the CDC, looking at data from nearly 190 hospitals in nine states, determined that unvaccinated people who had been infected months earlier were five times more likely to get COVID-19 than fully vaccinated people who didn't have a prior infection.

""Infection with this virus, if you survive, you do have some level of protection against getting infected in the future and particularly against getting serious infection in the future,"" said Dr. David Dowdy of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""It's important to note though that even those who have been infected in the past get additional protection from being vaccinated.""

Studies also show that COVID-19 survivors who get vaccinated develop extra-strong protection, what's called ""hybrid immunity."" When previously infected person gets a coronavirus vaccine, the shot acts like a booster and revs virus-fighting antibodies to high levels. The combination also strengthens another defensive layer of the immune system, helping create new antibodies that are more likely to withstand future variants.

The immunity debate comes as the country is experiencing another surge in infections and hospitalizations and 60 million people remain unvaccinated in a pandemic that has killed more than 770,000 Americans. Biden is hoping more people will get vaccinated because of workplace mandates set to take effect early next year but which face many challenges in the courts.

And many Republicans eager to buck Biden have embraced the argument that immunity from earlier infections should be enough to earn an exemption from the mandates.

""We recognize, unlike what you see going on with the federal proposed mandates and other states, we're actually doing a science-based approach. For example, we recognize people that have natural immunity,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who has been a chief critic of virus rules, said at a signing ceremony for sweeping legislation to hobble vaccine mandates this week.

The new Florida law forces private businesses to let workers opt out of COVID-19 mandates if they can prove immunity through a prior infection, as well as exemptions based on medical reasons, religious beliefs, regular testing or an agreement to wear protective gear. The state health department, which is led by Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, who opposes mandates and has drawn national attention over a refusal to wear a face mask during a meeting, will have authority to define exemption standards.

The Republican-led New Hampshire Legislature plans to take up a similar measure when it meets in January. Lawmakers in Idaho and Wyoming, both statehouses under GOP-control, recently debated similar measures but did not pass them. In Utah, a newly signed law creating exemptions from Biden's vaccine mandates for private employers allows people to duck the requirement if they have already had COVID.

And the debate is not unique to the U.S. Russia has seen huge numbers of people seeking out antibody tests to prove they had an earlier infection and therefore don't need vaccines.

Some politicians use the science behind natural immunity to advance narratives suggesting vaccines aren't the best way to end the pandemic.

""The shot is not by any means the only or proven way out of the pandemic. I'm not willing to give blind faith to the pharmaceutical narrative,"" said Idaho Republican Rep. Greg Ferch.

U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican and physician, along with 14 other GOP doctors, dentists and pharmacists in Congress, sent a letter in late September to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urging the agency, when setting vaccination policies, to consider natural immunity.

The White House has recently unveiled a host of vaccine mandates, sparking a flurry of lawsuits from GOP states, setting the stage for pitched legal battles. Among the rules are vaccine requirements for federal contractors, businesses with more than 100 employees and health care workers.

In separate lawsuits, others are challenging local vaccine rules using an immunity defense.

A 19-year-old student who refuses to be tested but claims he contracted and quickly recovered from COVID-19 is suing the University of Nevada, Reno, the governor and others over the state's requirement that everyone, with few exceptions, show proof of vaccination in order to register for classes in the upcoming spring semester. The case alleges that ""COVID-19 vaccination mandates are an unconstitutional intrusion on normal immunity and bodily integrity.""

Another case, filed by workers of Los Alamos National Laboratory, challenges their workplace vaccine mandate for civil rights and constitutional violations, arguing the lab has refused requests for medical accommodations for those workers who have fully recovered from COVID-19.

A similar lawsuit from Chicago firefighters and other city employees hit a bump last month when a judge said their case lacked scientific evidence to support the contention that the natural immunity for people who have had the virus is superior to the protection from the vaccine.

WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 90% of federal workers received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by Monday's deadline set by President Joe Biden.

Biden announced in September that more than 3.5 million federal workers were required to undergo vaccination, with no option to get regularly tested instead, unless they secured an approved medical or religious exemption. A U.S. official said the vast majority of federal workers are fully vaccinated, and that a smaller number have pending or approved exceptions to the mandate.

In all, more than 95% of federal workers are in compliance with the Biden mandate, the official said, either by being vaccinated or having requested an exemption. Workers who are not in compliance are set to begin a “counseling” process that could ultimately result in their termination if they don't get a shot or secure an approved exception to vaccination.

The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the statistics because the official wasn't authorized to speak on the record before their official release later Monday.

The deadline is a major test of Biden’s push to compel people across the country to get vaccinated, as his administration has emphasized that vaccination is the nation's surest way out from the pandemic. Beyond the federal worker rule, his administration is looking to compel large businesses to institute vaccinate-or-testing requirements that would cover more than 84 million workers, though plans for January enforcement have been on hold pending litigation.

There was considerable concern over whether federal employees would follow the mandate, particularly in law enforcement and intelligence agencies where there was vocal resistance, and among federal workers involved in the travel sector heading into the busy holiday travel season

The White House says they don’t anticipate any federal disruptions from the mandate. At the Federal Aviation Administration, 99% of employees are in compliance with Biden’s order, at the Transportation Security Administration, 93% are in compliance, and 98% of Customs and Border Protection workers are in compliance.

The official said that on Wednesday the Office of Management and Budget would release a breakdown of agency compliance rates.

According to the official, nearly 25% of the Internal Revenue Service’s employees started getting vaccinated after Biden’s announcement, and 98% of its employees are now in compliance with the requirement.

Just about two weeks ago, several intelligence agencies had at least 20% of their workforce unvaccinated as of late October, said U.S. Rep. Chris Stewart, a Utah Republican who is a member of the House Intelligence Committee. Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association President Larry Cosme said around the same time that there are about 31,000 members from 65 federal law enforcement agencies in the association and he estimated 60% of them have been vaccinated.

The White House is now aiming to use the federal vaccination mandate as a model for private businesses to implement their own mandates even before litigation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's is resolved.

Since Biden announced the first federal mandates earlier this summer, the number of unvaccinated Americans aged 12 and over has dropped from about 100 million to under 60 million. Health officials emphasize that the overwhelming majority of instances of serious illness and death from COVID-19 now occur among those who haven't received a vaccine.

7,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963465,health,"A new systematic review revealed that people living with certain cancers as well as those in remission face a significantly higher risk for stroke than people with no history of cancer.

Previous research has suggested such a link exists, but until now, the evidence has not been robust enough to elicit guidelines on stroke risk and prevention in cancer patients.

Given that historically, ""cancer prognosis has been very bad, [a potential cancer-stroke link] frankly didn't matter,"" said Eric Yang, MD, a cardiologist and director of the Cardio-Oncology Program at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was not involved in the current study.

However, now that cancer patients are living longer, it has become critical to better understand the downstream effects of the disease and treatment and to guide clinicians on patient follow-up, according to Melanie Turner, PhD, lead author on the meta-analysis and research fellow at the University of Aberdeen, in Scotland, United Kingdom.

To quantify stroke risk in patients with a history of cancer, Turner and her colleagues reviewed 36 studies, 25 of which calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for the incidence of stroke. The authors found that the majority of these studies reported a significantly increased incidence of stroke for patients with a range of cancers — including pancreatic, lung, colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancer, as well as leukemia — though the level of risk varied across cancer types, and a handful of studies showed a lower risk or no risk for stroke in patients with cancer.

According to the review, pancreatic cancer was associated with the highest risk for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (HR, 2.85 and 2.28, respectively). Lung cancer was not far behind, with HRs of 2.33 for ischemic and 2.14 for hemorrhagic stroke. In addition, head and neck cancer was associated an HR of 1.54 for hemorrhagic stroke.

Other studies showed a significantly increased incidence of stroke in patients with colorectal, breast, ovarian, and nasopharyngeal cancers as well as leukemia and myeloma. Stroke risk was greatest within the first 6 months of a cancer diagnosis. Some treatments increased stroke risk, including platinum-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer.

Overall, ""the review found strong evidence that patients with some types of cancer have higher risk of stroke,"" Turner told Medscape Medical News. However, a few studies found a lower risk or no risk of stroke — specifically for cervical, prostate, gastric, and testicular cancers.

The meta-analysis was challenging to conduct, according to Turner, largely because of the heterogeneity of the studies and the fact that the relationship between stroke incidence and cancer ""is not a simple one.""

""Cancer type, time since diagnosis of cancer, the types of anticancer treatments received, and shared risk factors such as smoking can all influence the risk of stroke after cancer,"" Turner and colleagues write.

More research is needed to understand how the two are connected. ""We still don't know the true cause — it's more of an association — and may be more of a combination of many things,"" Yang said.

Although no guidelines exist for stroke prevention or risk management for cancer patients, clinicians should be mindful that cancer can increase stroke risk. ""When they're seeing patients, [clinicians should] see that as an opportunity to look for risk factors of stroke and cardiovascular diseases,"" Turner said.

Yang suggested that the use of statins and other cardiovascular risk mitigators for cancer patients with a high risk for stroke warrants more investigation, and for especially high-risk patients — those with lung or pancreatic cancer — oncologists should be mindful of neurologic symptoms or blood clots.

Yang and Turner noted that, given the association between stroke and some cancers, helping patients with cancer control stroke risk factors — such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension — may be critical to prevention efforts.

""Keeping patients' stroke risk factors at bay might increase the chance they can continue their cancer treatment and improve their quality of life,"" Yang said.

The statement includes ethical considerations and recommendations for informed consent, and the AAN notes that neurologists should ensure that patients understand all of the issues and uncertainties surrounding the use of aducanumab.

Dr Winston Chiong

""Neurologists and other clinicians want to provide the best care to patients and families, particularly for a disease that is as challenging as Alzheimer's. We hope that this statement can be a guide for clinicians in communicating with patients and families in order to carefully consider decisions about the use of aducanumab,"" Winston Chiong, MD, PhD, University of California San Francisco Memory and Aging Center and a member of the AAN's Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee, told Medscape Medical News.

The statement was published online November 17 in Neurology.

Open, Honest Communication

As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the anti-amyloid agent aducanumab based on two studies that were both stopped prematurely for futility.

In subsequent post-hoc analyses of the available data, one of those studies indicated a statistically significant, albeit small, benefit with high-dose aducanumab, while the other study continued to show no benefit.

The clinical importance of the small statistical benefit in the single trial for daily function is unclear, and aducanumab was also associated with brain inflammation and brain bleeds in more than one third of patients who received the FDA-approved dose, which requires regular brain MRI monitoring.

All of this should be communicated to patients, the AAN advises.

Patients should also know that while aducanumab reduces beta-amyloid plaques in the brain that are markers of AD, it remains unclear whether this provides any meaningful benefit.

The AAN adds it's equally important to tell patients and families that aducanumab does not restore cognitive function and that there is insufficient data to offer it to people with moderate or advanced dementia or to those without evidence of beta-amyloid plaques.

It's also important to note that very few participants in the aducanumab trials were Hispanic, Black or Indigenous.

""Informed consent conversations with patients of populations underrepresented in clinical trials should include disclosure about the absence of safety and efficacy data in these groups,"" the authors note.

""New Territory"" for Neurologists

""There are two aspects of aducanumab that are relatively new territory for us as neurologists,"" Chiong told Medscape Medical News.

One is the controversy about the evidence for the drug. ""In the statement, we've tried to help clinicians communicate the uncertainty over aducanumab's risks and potential benefits,"" Chiong said.

The other is the high cost of the drug and how it will be covered.

Aducanumab has a price tag of $56,000 a year, which does not include the cost of infusing the drug, required repeat imaging, and medical management.

The AAN estimates annual costs of prescribing aducanumab may top $100,000 per year. With Medicare generally covering 80%, patients and families must be told that the full costs of treatment may not be covered.

""Regarding cost, we probably don't think often enough about what prescribing a drug means for an individual patient's finances and for the health system,"" said Chiong.

""In particular, when patients are in Medicare we might assume their healthcare costs will be sufficiently covered, but because aducanumab is so expensive its use is likely to impose very significant costs on individual patients as well as to the Medicare program,"" Chiong said.

In a news release, AAN President Orly Avitzur, MD, said, ""It is understandable why a new drug for Alzheimer's disease generates so much interest, because while its approval has been controversial, it still offers a glimmer of hope to patients and their families.""

""By using ethical principles to create this position statement, the American Academy of Neurology aims to help neurologists and other physicians transparently counsel patients and their families with a goal of providing the highest quality patient-centered care,"" Avitzur said.

This statement was approved by the Ethics, Law, and Humanities Committee, a joint committee of the AAN, American Neurological Association, and Child Neurology Society.

9,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963456,health,"US regulators have put some of the new clozapine risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program on temporary hold because of start-up difficulties, including long telephone wait times.

In a November 19 statement , the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it is temporarily suspending certain aspects of the program because of challenges reported by medical professionals who were trying to meet the original November 15 deadline.

In response, the FDA has conceded that pharmacists can dispense clozapine without a REMS dispense authorization (RDA). Wholesalers can continue to ship clozapine to pharmacies and health care settings without confirming enrollment in the REMS, the FDA also said.

""We encourage pharmacists and prescribers to continue working with the clozapine REMS to complete certification and patient enrollment,"" the FDA said in a statement.

In July, the FDA approved modifications to the clozapine REMS strategy. Clozapine is used to treat schizophrenia that is not well controlled with standard antipsychotics. It is also prescribed to patients with recurrent suicidal behavior associated with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

Although it is highly effective in some patients, it also carries serious risks. Specifically, it can decrease the neutrophil count, which can lead to severe neutropenia, serious infections, and death.

As a result, those taking the drug must undergo regular absolute neutrophil count (ANC) monitoring. Clozapine REMS is intended to maximize the benefits of the drug and minimize risk.

HCP Frustration

In its statement, the FDA said medical professionals had alerted the agency about ongoing difficulties with the clozapine REMS program, including a high call volume and long call wait times for stakeholders.

""We understand that this has caused frustration and has led to patient access issues for clozapine,"" the FDA said in a statement.

""Continuity of care, patient access to clozapine, and patient safety are our highest priorities,"" the FDA added. ""We are working closely with the clozapine REMS program administrators to address these challenges and avoid interruptions in patient care.""

Abrupt discontinuation of clozapine can result in significant complications, the FDA said. The agency urged use of ""clinical judgment' with respect to prescribing and dispensing clozapine to patients with an absolute neutrophil count within the acceptable range.

As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and other national groups in a September letter asked the FDA to delay the implementation of a new REMS program until after January 1, 2022.

10,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963438,health,"Although the estimated annual number of measles deaths decreased 94% from 2000 to 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic took a toll on both measles vaccination and surveillance, according to a recent report in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).

The number of World Health Organization (WHO) member states that achieved more than 90% coverage with the first dose of the measles vaccine (MCV1) declined 37% from 2019 to 2020. In 2020, 23 million infants did not receive MCV1 through routine immunization services, and another 93 million were affected by the postponement of mass immunizations or supplementary immunization activities because of the pandemic. Also, endemic transmission was reestablished in nine countries that had previously eliminated measles.

But perhaps the most overlooked aspect of COVID-19 is its effect on surveillance.

Katrina Kretsinger

""The entire COVID pandemic really put a lot of strain on the surveillance systems, not only for measles but for all vaccine-preventable disease, because there's a lot of overlap in the staff who work for surveillance,"" said Katrina Kretsinger, MD, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who contributed to the MMWR report.

Because of the stress on the systems, a lot fewer specimens were tested, she told Medscape Medical News. And it's not just measles that is at risk. This has had an impact on the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, which lost staff.

In addition, many vaccination campaigns ""were postponed and curtailed throughout 2020,"" Kretsinger said. The strengthening of surveillance systems — and immunization systems, more broadly — needs to be a priority.

""It's not clear that the children who were missed during that year were subsequently caught up,"" she explained. Having a ""cohort of children who have missed measles vaccine creates the reservoir of susceptibility that will provide the nidus for the next big outbreak.""

Measles is the indicator disease. That could mean a resurgence of other vaccine-preventable diseases as well.

Walter Orenstein

This report ""was written by some of the world's experts in measles, and it raises concerns about potential resurgence of measles,"" said Walter Orenstein, MD, professor of medicine, epidemiology, global health, and pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta. ""Measles is sort of a canary in the coal mine. If you look at vaccine-preventable diseases, measles is probably the most contagious, so the herd-immunity threshold is highest. Usually on the order of 92% to 94% immunity is needed to stop transmission.""

""Measles is the indicator disease,"" he told Medscape Medical News. ""That could mean a resurgence of other vaccine-preventable diseases as well."" Outbreaks don't just affect the countries where infections are occurring, they ""also affect our own domestic health security.""

""Some sort of periodic intensified routine immunization"" would be helpful, said Kretsinger, who recommends ""going through and selectively doing some sort of intensified efforts to catch children up early for the entire range of vaccines that they may have missed.""

""Some of these capture campaigns in areas that are thought to have the major problem would be very, very important,"" agreed Orenstein. ""A school entry check is one way of trying to look at kids, let's say at 4 to 6 years of age, in schools around the world,"" offering doses if they're unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated. ""Another is to try to improve surveillance and try to understand if the cases are vaccine failure or failure to vaccinate.""

""Where the health systems are the most fragile is where those gaps will be the last to be filled, if they are at all, and where we have the basic concerns,"" Kretsinger explained.

""Years ago, WHO recognized that vaccine hesitancy is a top global health threat,"" said Orenstein. ""People may not see these diseases so they don't mean much to them. Since vaccines, we're victims of our own success."" There's also a lot of incorrect information circulating.

""We need to realize — and it's been shown with COVID — that a decision not to vaccinate is not just a decision for your own child. It's a community decision,"" he pointed out. ""It's not my freedom to drive drunk, because not only do I put myself at risk, but others can't control the car. We have speed limits and other examples where we restrict personal choice because it can adversely affect individuals.""

""My favorite line is vaccines don't save lives, vaccinations save lives,"" Orenstein said. ""The vaccine dose that remains in the vial is 0% effective, no matter what the clinical trials show. And the issue, I think, is that we need to determine how to convince the hesitant to get confident enough to accept vaccination. For that, there is behavioral research; there's a whole bunch of things that need to be supported. Just purchasing the vaccine doesn't get it into the bodies.""

Kretsinger and Orenstein have disclosed no relevant financial relationships .

11,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963439,health,"With the holidays just around the corner (how did that happen?), it's a good time to remind yourself of the things you're grateful for.

Perhaps you're grateful for spending chilly evenings under a warm blanket binge-watching your favorite shows or being able to safely gather with loved ones. If you're William Shatner, maybe you're grateful for that quick trip to space (because apparently, that's a thing now) and the poetic tweets it induced. Down here on earth, TikTok has surpassed 1 billion users, and while we're not grateful, necessarily, we are entertained.

Here are the latest good, bad, and ugly TikToks that have been trending lately.

The Good: Doctor Demonstrates Correct EpiPen Use

This reaction TikTok from medical student Mutahir Farhan (aka @madmedicine) has over 252,000 likes and hundreds of comments. In it, Farhan watches a video of a young woman attempting to administer an EpiPen to her friend, with the caption ""How NOT to use an EpiPen"" over it (in bright red, of course).

The woman in the video is using the wrong end of the EpiPen against her friend's leg, so it isn't working. When she uses her thumb to press down and help, her thumb is actually pressed against the needle end and the EpiPen sticks her instead of her friend. Ouch!

Farhan goes on to explain the anatomy of the EpiPen and shows his audience of 1.1 million followers where to inject it.

""You gotta remember that the orange tip is where the needle comes out. Otherwise, you're going to end up stabbing yourself with epinephrine, like that girl in the video,"" Farhan says. He goes on to instruct the important, but often overlooked, follow-up: ""After you stab someone with epinephrine, call 911 or go to the ER, so that we can make sure they're actually okay and good to go.""

The Bad: Liquid Chlorophyll

Here is another one of those tricky trends that are so widespread and popular that it's hard to find exactly where it originated from. A video from @lenamaiah has over 5 million views and 800,000 likes, which even by TikTok standards, is a lot. TikTok is rife with similar videos, which feature drops of liquid chlorophyll being added to water and smoothies.

The pretty emerald hue is mesmerizing and it's hard to resist trying it out when it's being peddled by seemingly every pretty, smooth-skinned pseudo-model on the platform. In this video, Lena says drinking a glass of water with a few drops of chlorophyll can reduce inflammation, get rid of eye bags, boost your vitamin levels, reduce free radical damage, detoxify your system, and file your taxes. Okay, I made that last one up, but it follows, doesn't it? This stuff sounds pretty good. Maybe too good.

Chlorophyll, if you skipped biology class (somehow, I doubt you did), is what makes plants green. Medscape has a detailed explanation of chlorophyll, but all you really need to know is that it's the secret to that cool thing plants do: photosynthesis, or turning sunlight into energy. Scientists have been trying to find uses for it in people since the 1940s. Unfortunately, studies never found much that it can do for us, aside from being kind of deodorizing. So, while it's been historically marketed as toothpaste and deodorant, the new TikTok claims of it being a cure-all or the next big skincare supplement are not widely substantiated by scientific studies. The only real evidence of it being effective is word of mouth from those who claim to like the way they look or feel since taking it, which isn't enough for doctors to recommend it.

TikTok's resident dermatologist, Muneeb Shah, DO, stitched a TikTok from another user, with his captions explaining, ""[There's] no scientific evidence for liquid chlorophyll [helping] rosacea or acne.""

His advice: ""Chlorophyll is great, but just eat more veggies.""

The Ugly: Scalp Popping

Warning: Don't watch this if you're easily freaked out by weird body sounds. It's like cracking your knuckles but way, way worse.

This TikTok from @asmr.barber has 1.7 million likes, and lots of people are trying it out for themselves. The viral video features the (disturbed) art of scalp popping, also known as hair cracking. It features what is assumed to be some sort of barber or professional (here's hoping) twisting a client's hair around his fingers and then yanking, creating an audible popping sound. Many are posting their own hair cracking attempts on the platform. It's unclear if this is supposed to feel good or just be grossly satisfying, though some users claim it helps with migraines.

But it turns out this might be more than kind of gross; it can be dangerous, too.

Anthony Youn, MD, a board-certified plastic surgeon, comments on the trend with concern: ""What the hell is going on here?"" Not something you want to hear from a doctor. Youn explains that the popping sound comes from the galea aponeurotica, a fibrous sheet of connective tissue under your scalp, being pulled off the skull.

In a comment, Youn continued to warn people of replicating this trend: ""It can tear the inside of the scalp, which can bleed a ton on the inside. Think boxer or MMA fighter with scalp hematoma.""

Let's keep our scalps attached to our skulls, people. If I never have to hear that sound again, I'll be eternally grateful.

Until mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 emerged, RNA or DNA vaccines had not been used at a large scale even though the technology had existed for years. Now researchers are seeking ways to deliver these vaccines more efficiently, and they've found one: cupping, which is rooted in a practice used for centuries in China and the Middle East.

The tradition typically involves placing heated cups on a person's skin. As the air inside the cup cools, the air pressure under the cup drops. Practitioners believe that the resulting suction of the skin promotes healing, although evidence for its effectiveness is limited. But scientists suspected that the process might stimulate skin cells to soak up injected DNA as a vaccine or gene therapy.

In the body, injected RNA usually degrades quickly if it's unprotected. In the mRNA COVID vaccines, an oily droplet surrounds the mRNA, protecting it long enough to reach cells. DNA is less vulnerable to breakdown but faces a different problem: getting enough cells to take it up. Current methods to get DNA into cells include using an electric pulse to open an entry point for the DNA. But the side effects include muscle contractions, pain, and tissue damage, and the method isn't usable in people with pacemakers or other electrical device implants.

In a new study published in Science Advances, researchers tried out vaccination plus cupping on rats. They injected one or two doses of a DNA-only COVID vaccine, immediately followed by cupping suction where the shot was given. Even if only one dose of vaccine was used, the immune response with cupping was about 100 times greater than without cupping.

Scientists aren't certain why the suction helps, but they suspect that it strains the skin layers, stretching the cells so that they take up more of the DNA. This method of enhancing DNA uptake is less painful than other methods and has fewer side effects, including no tissue damage.

DNA vaccines don't require cold storage, making them an encouraging option in areas where maintaining low temperatures during vaccine transport can be difficult. A successful delivery system for DNA vaccines that doesn't involve the side effects of other methods could add another advantage. The company that developed this method, GeneOne Life Science, has already begun clinical trials with a DNA vaccine against COVID-19.

The Walt Disney Company has paused its COVID-19 vaccine mandate for employees at its theme parks in Florida after state lawmakers banned employers from requiring workers to get vaccinated.

Walt Disney World could have faced fines under the policy, a company spokesperson told The New York Times. The Biden administration has ordered vaccinations for workers in large companies, but Florida and other states have challenged the mandate in court.

The Florida legislature passed a bill blocking COVID-19 vaccine mandates, and Gov. Ron DeSantis signed it into law on Thursday. The new rule was promoted as an effort to protect workers who could lose their jobs.

""Nobody should lose their job due to heavy-handed COVID mandates, and we had a responsibility to protect the livelihoods of the people of Florida,"" DeSantis said in a statement.

The Florida law prevents employers from enforcing strict vaccine mandates and allows employees to request exemptions due to health or religious concerns, a previous coronavirus infection, or pregnancy or anticipated pregnancy. The law also says unvaccinated workers can get regular testing or wear protective equipment.

The fines for violating the ban could be $10,000 per day per each employee violation for businesses with fewer than 99 employees. For larger businesses, fines could be up to $50,000 per employee violation.

In August, Disney World reached a deal with employees to require theme park workers to be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus to keep their jobs. The company defended that rule again on Saturday, the Times reported.

""We believe that our approach to mandatory vaccines has been the right one as we've continued to focus on the safety and well-being of our cast members and guests,"" the company said.

More than 90% of active cast members in Florida have verified that they are fully vaccinated, the newspaper reported. The Walt Disney Company said the pause will remain in effect while the company assesses the new state law, according to an internal memo obtained by FOX 35 News in Orlando.

Florida-based cast members and employees who haven't verified their vaccination status will be required to follow safety protocols for unvaccinated people, including face coverings and physical distancing, the internal memo said.

The company also encourages guests to follow safety protocols by wearing face coverings, checking for symptoms, and getting vaccinated.

""We encourage people to get vaccinated,"" the company said.

The number of COVID-19 deaths recorded so far in 2021 has surpassed the total for 2020, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University.

Overall, more than 771,000 COVID-19 deaths have been reported in the U.S. during the pandemic. About 385,000 were reported in 2020, according to CDC data, and more than 386,000 have been reported this year.

The 2021 total will continue to increase in coming weeks as COVID-19 cases rise again in 30 states, according to The Hill. The national average for new daily cases has surpassed 90,000 again.

States that were hit hard early in the pandemic had some of the highest COVID-19 death rates per capita in 2020, according to a recent analysis by The Wall Street Journal. The Northeast had some of the highest death rates per 100,000 residents, especially New Jersey and New York, as well as North Dakota and South Dakota.

This year, Southern states have reported the highest death rates due to a major surge caused by the contagious Delta variant. Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and Tennessee have reported the highest death rates so far this year, the newspaper reported.

Vermont has the lowest COVID-19 death rate per 100,000 people since the pandemic began, according to the Journal. The state also has the most vaccinated population, with 72% fully vaccinated.

Mississippi has the highest death rate since the pandemic began, the newspaper reported. The state is among the least vaccinated states, with 47% fully vaccinated.

Most deaths tend to be among older adults, though younger people are dying more this year. About 81% of COVID-19 deaths hit ages 65 and older last year, falling to 69% this year. The deaths among people under 45 in 2021 have been more than double the deaths in that age group from last year.

In June, more people had died from COVID-19 globally this year than in 2020, according to an analysis that month by The Wall Street Journal. At that time, more than 1.883 million deaths had been recorded in the first 6 months of 2021, as compared to 1.88 million in 2020.

As of Monday, more than 5.1 million people worldwide had died from COVID-19 throughout the pandemic, the Johns Hopkins data shows.

Within a few weeks, perhaps before many Americans finish decorating for the holidays, the U.S. could have access to a new antiviral pill from Merck expected to alter the deadly trajectory of the covid-19 pandemic — with a second option from Pfizer to follow shortly after.

Now under federal review, both pills are being hailed by infectious-disease doctors not prone to superlatives.

""This is truly a game changer,"" said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an expert on infectious diseases and immunology at Columbia University. ""This is up there with vaccines. It's not a substitute for vaccines; we still want to get people vaccinated. But, boy, this is just another great tool to have.""

The new regimens, which require 30 or 40 pills to be taken over five days, have been shown to dramatically reduce hospitalizations and prevent deaths in adults with mild to moderate covid who are at risk for severe disease because of age or underlying conditions. But experts say the success of the treatments would hinge on one uncertain factor: whether high-risk patients infected with covid will be able to get tested — and then treated — fast enough to make a difference.

""Early, accessible testing and access to the results in a time frame that allows us to make a decision is really going to be key to these medications,"" said Dr. Erica Johnson, who chairs the Infectious Disease Board of the American Board of Internal Medicine. ""It puts the onus on our public health strategy to make these available.""

In clinical trials, molnupiravir, the antiviral drug developed by Merck & Co. and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, was given to non-hospitalized, unvaccinated, high-risk adult patients within five days of their first covid symptoms. Pfizer's product, Paxlovid, was tested in similar patients as early as three days — just 72 hours — after symptoms emerged.

Results from the Merck trial, released last month, showed the drug reduced the risk of hospitalizations by about 50% and prevented deaths entirely. It will be considered by an advisory panel to the federal Food and Drug Administration on Nov. 30. Pfizer officials, who requested FDA emergency authorization for their drug on Nov. 16, said Paxlovid cut the risk of hospitalizations and deaths by 89%. Both drugs work by hampering the way the covid virus reproduces, though they do so at different points in the process.

But those promising results assume the drugs can be administered in the narrow window of time used in the trials, a proven challenge when getting antiviral treatments to actual patients. Similar drugs can prevent dire outcomes from influenza if given early, but research shows that only about 40% of high-risk patients during five recent flu seasons sought medical care within three days of falling ill.

""That's just not human nature,"" said Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease programs for the Association of Public Health Laboratories. ""If you have a sniffle, you wait to see if it gets worse.""

Even when patients do seek early care, access to covid testing has been wildly variable since the start of the pandemic. U.S. testing capacity continues to be plagued by a host of problems, including supply-chain bottlenecks, staffing shortages, intermittent spikes in demand and results that can take hours — or far longer.

PCR, or polymerase chain reaction tests, the gold standard to detect SARS-CoV-2, can require scheduled appointments at medical offices or urgent care centers, and patients often wait days to learn the results. Rapid antigen tests are faster but less accurate, and some medical providers are hesitant to rely on them. Over-the-counter tests that can be used at home provide results quickly but are hard to find in stores and remain expensive. And it's not yet clear how those results would be confirmed and whether they would be accepted as a reason for treatment.

""Get ready,"" Griffin said. ""You don't want to call someone four days later to say, 'Ooh, you're now outside the window,' and the efficacy of this oral medication has been lost because of problems on our end with getting those results.""

The situation is expected to improve after a Biden administration push to invest $3 billion in rapid testing, including $650 million to ramp up manufacturing capacity for rapid tests. But it could be months before the change is apparent.

""Supplies will be getting better, but it's going to be slow,"" said Mara Aspinall, co-founder of Arizona State University's biomedical diagnostics program, who writes a weekly newsletter monitoring national testing capacity.

If getting tests will be tough, acquiring doses of the antiviral drugs is expected to be tougher, at least at first. The federal government has agreed to purchase about 3.1 million courses of molnupiravir for $2.2 billion, which works out to about $700 per course of treatment. The Biden administration is planning to announce a deal to pay $5 billion for 10 million courses of the Pfizer drug, paying about $500 per treatment course, according to The Washington Post.

Doses of the drugs distributed by the federal government would go to states and patients at no cost. But only a fraction of the planned inventory will be available to start, said Dr. Lisa Piercey, Tennessee's health commissioner, who has been part of a small group of state health officials working on the distribution plans.

Under one scenario, in which 100,000 courses of the Merck drug are available as early as Dec. 6, Piercey said Tennessee would receive just 2,000 patient courses even as the state is reporting more than 1,200 new cases a week on average. Deciding which sick patients receive those scarce supplies will be ""an educated stab in the dark,"" Piercey said.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials have said the antiviral treatments will be distributed through the same state-based system adopted for monoclonal antibody treatments. The lab-made molecules, delivered via IV infusion or injection, mimic human antibodies that fight the covid virus and reduce the risk of severe disease and death. Federal officials took over distribution in September, after a covid surge in Southern states with low vaccination rates led to a run on national supplies. They're now allotted to states based on the number of recent covid cases and hospitalizations and past use.

The antivirals will be cheaper than the monoclonal antibody treatments, which cost the government about $1,250 per dose and can carry infusion fees that leave patients with hundreds of dollars in copays. The pills are much easier to use, and pharmacies likely will be allowed to order and dispense them for home use.

Still, the antiviral pills won't replace the antibody treatments, said Dr. Brandon Webb, an infectious-disease specialist at Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City.

Questions remain about the long-term safety of the drugs in some populations. Merck's molnupiravir works by causing mutations that prevent the virus from reproducing. The Pfizer treatment, which includes Paxlovid and a low dose of ritonavir, an HIV antiretroviral, may cause interactions with other drugs or even over-the-counter supplements, Webb said.

Consequently, the antivirals likely won't be used in children, people with kidney or liver disease, or pregnant people. They'll need to be administered to patients capable of taking multiple pills at once, a couple of times a day, and those patients should be monitored to make sure they complete the therapy.

""We'll be on an interesting tightrope in which we'll be trying to identify eligible patients early on to treat them with antivirals,"" Webb said. ""We're just going to need to be nimble and ready to pivot."""
16,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963444,health,"In a randomized controlled trial of close to 1000 Ugandan children and youth with latent rheumatic heart disease (RHD), those who received monthly injections of penicillin G benzathine for 2 years had less disease progression than those who did not.

RHD, a valvular heart disease caused by rheumatic fever that develops after untreated Streptococcus pyogenes infection, is the most common acquired cardiovascular disease among children and young adults.

""It is clear that secondary antibiotic prophylaxis can improve outcomes for children with echo-detected rheumatic RHD,"" co-lead author of the study, Andrea Z. Beaton, MD, told theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology.

""There is huge potential here, but we are not quite ready to advocate for this strategy as a broad public health approach,"" said Beaton, a pediatric cardiologist at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio.

""We need to understand more the practical translation of this strategy to a low-resourced public health system at scale, improve [penicillin G benzathine] supply, and improve community and healthcare worker knowledge of this disease.""

Beaton presented the findings in the at the American Heart Association (AHA) 2021 Scientific Sessions, and the study was simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine on November 13.

The GOAL trial — or the Gwoko Adunu pa Lutino trial, meaning ""protect the heart of a child"" — screened 102,200 children and adolescents aged 5 to 17. Of these kids and teenagers, 926 (0.9%) were diagnosed with latent RHD based on a confirmatory electrocardiogram.

""For now, I would say, if you are screening, then kids found to have latent RHD should be put on prophylaxis,"" Beaton said.

""I think this is also a powerful call for more research [severely lacking in RHD],"" to improve risk stratification, determine how to implement screening and prophylaxis programs, and develop new and better approaches for RHD prevention and care.

""This essential trial partially addresses the clinical equipoise that has developed regarding penicillin administration in latent RHD,"" said Gabriele Rossi, MD, MPH, who was not involved with this research.

It showed that out of the final 818 participants included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, a total of 3 (0.8%) in the prophylaxis group had echocardiographic progression at 2 years, compared with 33 participants (8.2%) in the control group (risk difference, −7.5 percentage points; 95% CI, −10.2 to −4.7; P < .001).

""This is a significant difference,"" Rossi, from Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), Brussels, Belgium, told theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology in an email, noting that, however, it is not known what happens after 2 years.

The authors estimated that 13 children or adolescents with latent rheumatic heart disease would need to be treated to prevent disease progression in 1 person at 2 years, which is ""acceptable,"" he continued.

However, ""screening, diagnosis, clinical follow-up, treatment, and program management [would] require substantial strengthening of health systems and the workforce, which is still far from being realizable in many African and low-income-country settings,"" Rossi noted.

Related Study in Italy

Previously, Rossi and colleagues conducted a trial, published in 2019, that showed it was feasible to screen for asymptomatic RHD among refugee/migrant children and youths in Rome, Italy.

From February 2016–January 2018, they screened more than 650 refugee/migrant children and adolescents who were younger than 18. They came largely from Egypt (65%) but also from 22 other countries and were often unaccompanied or with just one parent.

The number needed to screen was 5 to identify a child/youth with borderline RHD and around 40 to identify a child/youth with definite RHD.

Rossi noted that local resurgences of RHD have also been also documented in high-income countries such as Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US, often among disadvantaged indigenous people, as described in a 2018 Letter to the Editor in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Beaton noted that a review of 10-year data (2008-2018) from 22 US pediatric institutions showed that, in the US, the prevalence of RHD ""is higher in immigrant children from RHD endemic areas, but because of total numbers, more RHD cases than not are domestic."" Children living in more deprived communities are at risk for more severe disease, and the burden in US territories is also quite high. Beaton led that review, which was published this past August in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

Screening and Secondary Prophylaxis

The aim of the current GOAL study was to evaluate if screening and treatment with penicillin G benzathine could detect and prevent progression of latent rheumatic heart disease in 5- to 17-year-olds living in Gulu, Uganda. The trial was conducted from July 2018–October 2020.

""School education and community sensitization was done prior to the trial,"" through radio shows or school-based education, Beaton explained. About 99% of the children/adolescents/families agreed to be screened.

The group has been conducting echo screening research in Uganda for 10 years, she noted. They have developed peer group and case manager strategies to aid participant retention, as they describe in an article about the study protocol.

The screening echocardiograms were interpreted by about 30 providers and four cardiologists reviewed confirmatory echocardiograms.

Two participants in the prophylaxis group had serious adverse events that were attributable to receipt of prophylaxis, including one episode of a mild anaphylactic reaction (representing < 0.1% of all administered doses of prophylaxis).

Once children and adolescents have moderate/severe RHD, there is not much that can be done in lower-middle income countries, where surgery for this is uncommon, Beaton explained. Around 30% of children and adolescents with this condition who come to clinical attention in Uganda die within 9 months.

Further Research

Beaton and colleagues have just started a trial to investigate the burden of RHD among Native American youth, which has not been studied since the 1970s.

They also have an ongoing study looking at the efficacy of a pragmatic, community-based sore throat program to prevent RHD.

""Unfortunately, this strategy has not worked well in low-to-middle income countries, for a variety of reasons so far,"" Beaton noted, and the cost-effectiveness of this preventive strategy is questionable.

The trial was supported by the Thrasher Research Fund, Gift of Life International, Children's National Hospital Foundation (Zachary Blumenfeld Fund and Race for Every Child [Team Jocelyn]), the Elias–Ginsburg Family, Wiley Rein, Philips Foundation, AT&T Foundation, Heart Healers International, the Karp Family Foundation, Huron Philanthropies, and the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Heart Institute Research Core. Beaton and Rossi have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

What to know:

Most of the currently developed vaccines for COVID-19 have brand names, but the general public, the media, and medical professionals still mostly use the pharmaceutical companies' names, like ""the Pfizer vaccine"" or ""the Moderna vaccine.""

This is partly due to lack of marketing. As the only vaccine with full FDA approval (rather than emergency use approval), only the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine can be used in marketing within the US. Ad campaigns have also thus far been unnecessary due to the high demand and limited supply of the vaccines.

The Brand Institute, a name developer that partners on 75% of all pharma brand approvals and nonproprietary name approvals, was involved in creating all five of the known COVID vaccine names so far: Pfizer's Comirnaty, Moderna's Spikevax, AstraZeneca's Vaxevria, Novavax's Nuvaxovid, and Sanofi's Vidprevtyn.

The brand names have met with some ridicule from media personalities and on social media. Talk show hosts Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon both made fun of the Pfizer vaccine's name, ""Comirnaty,"" after it received official FDA approval in August.

According to the Brand Institute's president of operations and communication, Scott Piergrossi, the ""Comirnaty"" brand name drew from the words ""COVID"" and ""mRNA,"" referring to the technology it uses, and is meant to play on the words ""community"" and ""immunity.""

This is a summary of the article, ""Name That Vaccine: From Comirnaty to Spikevax to Nuvaxovid, Covid-19 Shots' Brand Names Remain Little-Known,"" published by Endpoints on November 22. The full article can be found on endpts.com .

Covid-19 cases continued to climb across Europe this week, prompting fresh public health restrictions in some countries. The wave of infections has also fanned concerns in the United States about a larger than hoped-for winter surge.

Cases began to rise steadily in Europe in September. By Nov. 4, with Covid-19 cases and fatalities mounting on the continent, Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization's regional director for Europe, told reporters that Europe was ""back at the epicenter of the pandemic.""

While countries with high vaccination rates — including Portugal, Italy, and Spain — have experienced an uptick in cases, the outbreak has hit hardest in countries with large pockets of unvaccinated people, especially in Central and Eastern Europe.

In Germany, where around 68 percent of people are fully vaccinated — more than the U.S., but lower than many other European countries — case rates earlier this month surpassed a record set in December 2020. Still, vaccination has mitigated the number of severe cases in Germany and other countries experiencing a surge.

In Austria, which has lower vaccination rates than most other wealthy European nations, policymakers have implemented vigorous restrictions on those choosing to forego vaccination. In a policy that went into effect on Monday, unvaccinated people are ""allowed to leave their homes only for work, food shopping, or emergencies,"" according to NPR. On Friday, the country's leaders broadened restrictions, announcing a national lockdown to begin next week.

The situation is worse in Eastern Europe, where vaccine uptake has lagged and fatality rates in some countries are reaching new records. In Russia, authorities reported 1,254 Covid-19 fatalities on Friday, higher than at any other point in the pandemic. (The country's mortality data has not always been reliable.) Russia, the first country to approve a Covid-19 vaccine, thanks to an accelerated process that controversially bypassed late-stage clinical trials, also has a long history as a global purveyor of medical disinformation campaigns. Vaccination rates there hover just above one-third of the population, lower than nearly any other middle or upper-income country.

What the rising cases in Europe mean for the U.S. is unclear. They may offer a warning: As The Los Angeles Times observed last week, ""in the nearly two years since the pandemic began, Europe's waves of infection have often presaged similar suffering across the Atlantic."" Indeed, late last week, The Washington Post reported that the rise in cases in Europe has alarmed White House officials, leading some to push for a more rapid expansion of booster shots. The Food and Drug Administration complied this week by authorizing boosters of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for all adults — something already permitted in some parts of the country. (Even without a booster, authorized vaccines offer robust, lasting protection against severe cases of Covid-19 for most adults.)

Despite the warning signs from Europe, there's also reason to be cautiously optimistic. While Covid-19 remains a threat, scientific research has yielded significant tools since the peak last winter, when more than 3,000 Americans were dying from Covid-19 each day and vaccines were scare. More than 99 percent of people aged 65 and above — who account for the lion's share of severe Covid-19 cases and fatalities — have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to federal data. In addition, pending authorization from federal regulators, a pair of promising antiviral drugs may soon help cut down the rates of severe infection among people who do contract Covid-19. Meanwhile, testing capacity is growing, perhaps allowing more nimble, targeted responses to outbreaks.

Undark's Abstracts column first noted the threat of a novel coronavirus on January 10, 2020. Since then, the Undark team has worked diligently to offer weekly updates on the pandemic — all part of Abstracts' five-years-and-running effort to furnish readers with a roundup of essential science news.

As the COP26 climate talks drew to a close in Glasgow last weekend, world leaders worked overtime to come to terms on a global agreement to address climate change. The final deal, agreed to by nearly 200 countries on Saturday, calls on governments to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, establishes rules governing international carbon markets, and reaffirms the world's goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above pre-industrial levels. Experts call the agreement a significant step that nevertheless falls short of what's needed to stave off climate catastrophe. ""COP26 has closed the gap,"" climate researcher Niklas Hoehne told Nature, ""but it has not solved the problem."" Onlookers expressed particular disappointment in language that called for the phasing down, rather than phasing out, of coal-fired power. The agreement also leaves key questions about financing climate efforts of lower-income countries unaddressed. Still, Harvard University economist Robert Stavins said the deal was ""basically as good as one could hope for."" Attention now turns to Capitol Hill, where a clutch of centrist Democrats will decide the fate of President Biden's Build Back Better plan, a $1.75 trillion proposal that includes $555 billion in climate spending. The House is expected to vote on the measure as soon as this week. (Nature)

Scientists reported this week that they had identified a second person infected with HIV whose immune system successfully fended off the disease without medical help. In a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers said they'd scanned more than a billion cells from a 30-year-old Argentinian woman, identified only as ""Patient Esperanza,"" without finding a trace of active virus — even though the woman had received no antiviral medical care. The finding follows last year's announcement that a 67-year-old California woman's immune system had also apparently wiped out HIV infection without help. ""This is really the miracle of the human immune system that did it,"" said one of the authors of this week's report, according to NBC News, adding that the next step is to figure out what distinguishes the immune system of these two patients. More than 38 million people around the world live with HIV, but before these two patients were discovered, the only people considered fully cured of HIV were two men treated with an experimental stem cell therapy. Since then, though, researchers have come to suspect that a small group of people possess immune systems unusually capable of fending off the infection without help, even if some traces of the virus typically remain in their bodies. The next step is to figure out what lies behind that special ability — and to perhaps use that knowledge to help others. (STAT)

On Monday, passengers aboard the International Space Station had to shelter in place due to space debris from a Russian missile blast. According to The Verge, the ground-based missile likely hit an old Russian satellite named Kosmos 1408, breaking it into more than 1,500 trackable chunks and thousands of smaller, untraceable pieces. NASA reported that the shot was a test of one of Russia's anti-satellite weapons, or ASATs. The weapons are designed to take out satellites and, as The Verge notes, countries test them in order to show off their destructive capabilities. ASAT tests also add to low orbital debris — bits of human-made waste from abandoned vehicles, satellites, and more, which travel at about 17,500 miles per hour and threaten functional technology, including the ISS. The Russian test apparently came without warning; at a press briefing, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department called it ""dangerous, reckless, and irresponsible."" But Russia didn't break any laws, because existing laws — which, some experts argue, are woefully outdated — don't cover most space weapons, although they do bar the use of weapons of mass destruction in space. As Daniel Porras, a Space Security Fellow at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told Undark last year: ""What worries us in the international community is that there aren't necessarily any guard rails for how people are going to start interfering with others' space systems. There are no rules of engagement."" (The Verge)

And finally: In a recent study published in the journal Animals, scientists showed evidence that the drawings of orangutans may reflect their individual personalities and abilities. Scientists analyzed more than 1,400 drawings done by five orangutans at the Tama Zoological Park over a 10 year period. Most of the pictures were made by Molly, an orangutan who started drawing at the age of 54. The scientists contrasted her work with younger primates and found variations in the pressure with which the crayon was applied, as well as the area they covered while drawing. According to Science, Molly pressed her crayons lightly compared to a 10-year-old orangutan. She liked using fewer colors and covered less area while drawing. Also, her color preferences changed over different seasons: For example, she would use green when drawing in summer and winter and purple in spring. Researchers also looked at the time duration for which an orangutan drew. Studying these primate drawings, the scientists hope to find answers to what would have motivated our human ancestors to produce rock or cave art. (Science)

19,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963434,health,"People who got the zoster (shingles) vaccine the same day as their annual influenza shot were more likely to skip their flu shot the following year than people who got the two shots on separate days, according to results from a new study.

Evidence suggests that people mistakenly think adverse effects commonly related to the zoster vaccine — including chills, fever, pain, and nausea — are caused by the flu vaccine, researchers write in an original investigation published in JAMA Network Open.

Benjamin Rome

The work by Benjamin Rome, MD, MPH, a primary care physician from the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and colleagues was published online November 19.

The study involved 89,237 people with an average age of 72 years. Researchers used Optum's deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart Database, a national, commercial health insurance claims database that contains information on 17 million patients with commercial insurance and Medicare Advantage plans in all 50 states.

The cohort consisted of people at least 50 years of age who received the influenza vaccine between August 1, 2018 and March 31, 2019, and received the shingles vaccine on the same day or separately in the previous 6 months.

Those who had both shots the same day (n = 27,161) were significantly less likely than those who got them on different days (n = 62,076) to get their annual flu shot the next (2019/20) flu season (87.3% vs 91.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.71 - 0.78; P < .001). Results were similar across subgroups.

L.J. Tan

Although the difference between the two groups in the percentage of people getting the influenza shot the subsequent year was only 4 percentage points, when applied to the entire population getting shots concurrently, the number potentially affected is large, L.J. Tan, MS, PhD, chief strategy officer with the Immunization Action Coalition in St. Paul, Minnesota, told Medscape Medical News.

Addressing the issue could make a difference; however, asking people to get the shingles and influenza shots on different days might result in lack of adherence, he said. ""Most adults will not come back.""

A better way to address the potential problem is to educate people about the adverse effects of the shingles shot so they don't mistakenly think the flu shot made them feel ill when they get both together, said Tan.

He noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorses giving vaccines — including the COVID-19 vaccine — concurrently to get patients caught up and has deemed them safe and effective when coadministered.

""We also know that the reactogenicity does not amplify because you got two vaccines together,"" Tan said.

Rome agreed that education is key. ""Our study doesn't suggest that you shouldn't get the shingles and flu vaccine together. It really just suggests that we ought to be much more careful about advising patients about side effects of vaccines,"" he told Medscape Medical News.

Even if a small percentage of people are vaccine hesitant because they misunderstand adverse effects, he said, ""that's important for us to know, from a public health standpoint.""

Rome said he would like to repeat the study results using the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu shot to see if COVID-19 adverse effects also get incorrectly assigned to coadministered flu shots.

Shingles Vaccine Has Well-Known Adverse Effects

The recombinant zoster vaccine, approved in 2017, has replaced the live attenuated zoster vaccine. The previous vaccine caused fewer adverse effects but was far less effective in preventing shingles in older adults.

The recombinant vaccine is now recommended for most adults at least 50 years of age as a one-time, two-dose series.

It is critical to discern the reasons people are not getting their flu shots because fewer than half of American adults get an annual flu shot. Of those, 30% cite potential adverse effects as the reason for hesitation.

However, only injection-site symptoms, such as pain, redness, and swelling, are known to be caused by the influenza vaccine.

Researchers adjusted for factors that could differ between the two study groups, including demographic, clinical, and healthcare use variables.

They also adjusted for insurance type, month, and location (office vs pharmacy) of the 2018/19 influenza vaccination, and concurrent administration of any additional vaccines besides the zoster vaccine.

""We also adjusted for several comorbidities known to increase the risk of complications from influenza, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, chronic kidney disease, or liver disease, and immunocompromising conditions,"" the authors write.

They also took into account whether people in the study had had the flu vaccine in the year prior to the study.

""Somebody who has received the flu vaccine 2 years in a row is far more likely to get it a third time, as opposed to someone who just gets it intermittently,"" Rome noted.

To further test their results, the researchers looked at whether people engaged in other preventive measures, such as cancer screenings or tetanus vaccines, in the subsequent year. They found no significant differences between the groups.

That suggests that that the two groups seemed equally likely to get preventive services, he said. ""Something about the flu vaccine seems to stand out.""

20,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963437,health,"Addition of echocardiogram measurement of biventricular dysfunction improved the accuracy of prognosis among patients with cardiac shock (CS) in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU).

In patients in the CICU with cardiac shock, biventricular dysfunction (BVD) as assessed using transthoracic echocardiography improves clinical risk stratification when combined with the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) shock stage.

No improvements in risk stratification was seen with patients with left or right ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD or RVSD) alone, according to an article published in the journal Chest.

Ventricular systolic dysfunction is commonly seen in patients who have suffered cardiac shock, most often on the left side. Although echocardiography is often performed on these patients during diagnosis, previous studies looking at ventricular dysfunction used invasive hemodynamic parameters, which made it challenging to incorporate their findings into general CICU practice.

Pinning Down Cardiac Shock

Although treatment of acute myocardial infarction and heart failure has improved greatly, particularly with the implementation of percutaneous coronary intervention (primary PCI) for ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI). This has reduced the rate of future heart failure, but cardiac shock can occur before or after the procedure, with a 30-day mortality of 30%-40%. This outcome hasn't improved in the last 20 years.

Efforts to improve cardiac shock outcomes through percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices have been hindered by the fact that CS patients are heterogeneous, and prognosis may depend on a range of factors.

SCAI was developed as a five-stage classification system for CS to improve communication of patient status, as well as to improve differentiation among patients participation in clinical trials. It does not include measures of ventricular dysfunction.

Simple Measure Boosts Prognosis Accuracy

The new work adds an additional layer to the SCAI shock stage. ""Adding echocardiography allows discrimination between levels of risk for each SCAI stage,"" said David Baran, MD, who was asked for comment. Baran was the lead author on the original SCAI study and is system director of advanced heart failure at Sentara Heart Hospital, as well as a professor of medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virginia.

The work also underscores the value of repeated measures of prognosis during a patient's stay in the ICU. ""If a patient is not improving, it may prompt a consideration of whether transfer or consultation with a tertiary center may be of value. Conversely, if a patient doesn't have high-risk features and is responding to therapy, it is reassuring to have data supporting low mortality with that care plan,"" said Baran.

The study may be biased, since not every patient undergoes an echocardiogram. Still, ""the authors make a convincing case that biventricular dysfunction is a powerful negative marker across the spectrum of SCAI stages,"" said Baran.

Echocardiography is simple and generally available, and some are even portable and used with a smartphone. But patient body size interferes with echocardiography, as can the presence of a ventilator or multiple surgical dressings. ""The key advantage of echo is that it is completely noninvasive and can be brought to the patient in the ICU, unlike other testing which involves moving the patient to the testing environment,"" said Baran.

The researchers analyzed data from 3158 patients admitted to the CICU at the Mayo Clinic Hospital St. Mary's Campus, 51.8% of whom had acute coronary syndromes. They defined LVSD as a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%, and RVSD as at least moderate systolic dysfunction determined by semi-quantitative measurement. BVD constituted the presence of both LVSD and RVSD. They examined the association of in-hospital mortality with these parameters combined with SCAI stage.

BVD a Risk Factor

Overall in-hospital mortality was 10%. A total of 22.3% of patients had LVSD and 11.8% had RVSD; 16.4% had moderate or greater BVD. There was no association between LVSD or RVSD and in-hospital mortality after adjustment for SCAI stage, but there was a significant association for BVD (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.815; P = .0023). When combined with SCAI, BVC led to an improved ability to predict hospital mortality (area under the curve [AUC], 0.784 vs 0.766; P < .001). Adding semi-quantitative RVSD and LVSD led to more improvement (AUC, 0.794; P < .01 vs both).

RVSD was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.421; P = .02), and there was a trend toward greater mortality with LVSD (aOR, 1.336; P = .06). There was little change when SCAI shock stage A patients were excluded (aOR, 1.840; P < .001).

Patients with BVD had greater in-hospital mortality than those without ventricular dysfunction (aOR, 1.815; P = .0023), but other between-group comparisons were not significant.

The researchers performed a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis using left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and semi-quantitative RVSD. It found that RVSD was a better predictor of in-hospital mortality than LVSD, and the best cutoff for LVSD was different among patients with RVSD and patients without RVSD.

Patients with mild or greater RVD and LVEF >24% were considered high risk; those with borderline or low RVSD and LVEF <33%, or mild or greater RVSD with LVEF ≥ 24%, were considered intermediate risk. Patients with borderline or no RVSD and LVEF ≥ 33% were considered low risk. Hospital mortality was 22% in the high-risk group, 12.2% in the intermediate group, and 3.3% in the low-risk group (aOR vs intermediate, 0.493; P = .0006; aOR vs high-risk, 0.357; P < .0001).

21,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963431,health,"The time of day of immunotherapy infusions matters for cancer patients' survival, a recent review found.

The study, which included almost 300 patients with stage IV melanoma, revealed that overall survival was longer for those who received immunotherapy infusions more frequently in the morning or early afternoon compared with those who received late afternoon or evening infusions.

The time of day of immunotherapy was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in a multivariable analysis, regardless of corticosteroid or radiotherapy use.

""Our findings are in line with an increasing body of evidence that adaptive immune responses are less robust when initially stimulated in the evening than if stimulated in the daytime,"" according to the investigators, led by David Qian, MD, PhD, a radiation oncology resident at Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.

Qian and colleagues also suggest that suboptimal timing of infusions may help explain why 40% of cancer patients don't benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors.

These findings, published on November 12 in The Lancet Oncology, ""could be used to guide immunotherapy infusion scheduling with the goal of optimizing treatment response,"" Qian and colleagues write.

Francis Levi, MD, PhD, a medical oncologist at the University of Warwick, in Coventry, United Kingdom, agrees. In an editorial, Levi writes that the results could ""change clinical practice"" if they hold up in prospective, randomized trials.

The recent analysis adds to a growing body of literature that synching immunotherapy infusions with patients' circadian rhythms can lead to a more robust immune response.

Levi, who has been studying the timing of cancer therapies for decades, recently reported that morning infusions of nivolumab substantially reduced the risk for early progression and death among 95 patients with stage IV non–small cell lung cancer. These morning infusions were an independent predictor of progression-free and overall survival.

In addition, other analyses have shown that morning vaccinations elicit a stronger adaptive immune response than ones given in the afternoon or evening.

Despite the ""well-known"" influence of circadian clocks on peoples' immune response, timing immunotherapy infusions to coincide with this more favorable immune response window has not gotten much attention in the medical community, Levi noted.

Inside the Emory Analysis

The latest study focused on 299 adults with stage IV melanoma who had received four or more infusions of ipilimumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab, either alone or in combination, between 2012 and 2020.

At a median follow-up of 27 months, Qian and colleagues found that on average, patients who had received at least 20% of their infusions after 4:30 PM faced a 31% greater risk for all-cause death (P = .046). This effect was particularly robust early in the treatment course and was more pronounced in women, patients with brain metastases, and those who had received dual immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

To control for confounders, the researchers matched 73 patients who had received at least 20% of their infusions after 4:30 PM with 73 who had not. The patients were matched as to age, performance status, serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration, and receipt of corticosteroids and radiotherapy. This 4:30 PM threshold was based, in part, on previous vaccine studies, the authors say.

In the matched pairs, later infusions were associated with shorter overall survival — it was 4.8 years in the later group and was not reached in the early group (P = .038).

""We were somewhat surprised but also delighted that the effect direction is completely consistent with the vaccine literature,"" Qian told Medscape Medical News. ""Within our own institution, earlier infusions may be encouraged, but it will likely not gain widespread appeal until stronger evidence is presented, and we don't know whether this phenomenon applies outside of melanoma.""

Qian said he and his team are designing a randomized trial in patients with advanced melanoma ""to rigorously assess the effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor time-of-day infusion patterns on patient outcomes.""

Almost 9 in 10 younger adults with diabetes experienced disruptions in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, new data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest.

In a survey of 760 adults with medication-treated diabetes, younger adults with diabetes were more likely than older people with the condition to report experiencing disruptions in healthcare during the pandemic and to engage less in efforts to prevent SARS‑CoV‑2 transmission, including vaccination.

The data were published November 19 in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report by Catherine Barrett, PhD, an epidemiologist in the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, and colleagues.

""Efforts are warranted to enhance access to diabetes care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to deliver public health messages emphasizing the importance of diabetes management and COVID-19 prevention, including vaccination, especially among younger adults with diabetes,"" the authors write.

The 760 patients with medication-treated diabetes were among a larger nationwide sampling of adults who completed the COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation Initiative, an internet-based survey administered by Qualtrics in February and March 2021.

Younger adults (aged 18-29) were significantly less likely to report having health insurance (77%) compared with those aged 30-59 (91%) or 60 years and older (97%).

Those aged 18-29 and 30-59 were more likely to report diagnosed mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder compared with those aged 60 and older (86%, 64%, and 32%, respectively).

Younger adults were significantly more likely to believe that they weren't at high risk for severe COVID-19, including 94% of those aged 18-29 and 76% of those aged 30-59, compared with just 52% of those aged 60 and older. The youngest group was also less likely than older adults to practice COVID-19 prevention behaviors including mask-wearing, physical distancing, and avoiding gatherings, at just 30% compared with 64% of the middle-aged and 72% of the oldest group.

Patients declaring that they intended to be vaccinated were 66% of those aged 18-29 years, compared with 77% of 30- to 59-year-olds and 85% of those aged 60 and older.

The youngest group was also the least likely to have had in-person medical appointments (53%), compared with 76% of the middle-aged group and 85% of those age 60 years and older. Both younger groups were more likely than the oldest to report delayed healthcare (87%, 63%, and 26%, respectively).

""These data show that almost 9 in 10 younger adults with diabetes delayed healthcare. Diabetes is a serious health condition that puts people at risk for heart attack, stroke, blindness, amputations, and other serious diabetes complications. Early treatment and diabetes management can help prevent or delay diabetes-related health conditions and improve overall health,"" Barrett told Medscape Medical News.

Barrett said that use of telehealth didn't significantly differ by age group, ranging from 40% to 51%.

""Telehealth is important for continuity of care for people living with diabetes, but it's important for patients to continue to receive routine in-person care as well, particularly for obtaining up-to-date labs and other tests for prevention of diabetes complications,"" she noted.

Information about diabetes type wasn't included.

""The assessment did not collect information on insulin use, age of diagnosis, or self-report of diabetes type, so it was not possible to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is likely that, among the younger adults in our study, type 1 diabetes was more common than type 2 diabetes, although type 2 is on the rise among younger adults as well,"" Barrett said.

The investigators plan to repeat the survey with nationally representative data that will be available in 2022.

Barrett is a CDC employee and has reported no relevant financial relationships.

23,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963427,health,"Concomitant rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (RSsNP) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with a poorer, disease-specific, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a Norwegian study is showing.



""Chronic rhinosinusitis has an impact on patients' HRQoL,"" lead author Marte Rystad Øie, Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway, told Medscape Medical News in an email.

""We found that RSsNP in COPD was associated with more psychological issues, higher COPD symptom burden, and overall COPD-related HRQoL after adjusting for lung function, so RSsNP does have clinical relevance and [our findings] support previous studies that have suggested that rhinosinusitis should be recognized as a comorbidity in COPD,"" she emphasized.

The study was published in the November 1 issue of Respiratory Medicine.

Study Sample

The study sample consisted of 90 patients with COPD and 93 control subjects, all age 40-80 years. ""Generic HRQoL was measured with the Norwegian version of the SF-36v2 Health Survey Standard questionnaire,"" the authors write, and responses were compared between patients with COPD and controls as well as between subgroups of patients who had COPD both with and without RSsNP.

Disease-specific HRQoL was assessed by the Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22); the St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), and responses were again compared between patients who had COPD with and without RSsNP. In the COPD group, ""severe"" and ""very severe"" airflow obstruction was present in 56.5% of patients with RSsNP compared with 38.6% of patients without RSsNP, as Øie reports.

Furthermore, total SNOT-22 along with psychological subscale scores were both significantly higher in patients who had COPD with RSsNP than those without RSsNP. Among those with RSsNP, the mean value of the total SNOT-22 score was 36.8 whereas the mean value of the psychological subscale score was 22.6. Comparable mean values among patients who had COPD without RSsNP were 9.5 and 6.5, respectively (P < .05).

Total scores on the SGRQ were again significantly greater in patients who had COPD with RSsNP at a mean of 43.3 compared with a mean of 34 in those without RSsNP, investigators observe. Similarly, scores for the symptom and activity domains again on the SGRQ were significantly greater for patients who had COPD with RSsNP than those without nasal polyps. As for the total CAT score, once again it was significantly higher in patients who had COPD with RSsNP at a mean of 18.8 compared with a mean of 13.5 in those without RSsNP (P < .05).

Indeed, patients with RSsNP were four times more likely to have CAT scores indicating the condition was having a high or very high impact on their HRQoL compared with patients without RSsNP (P < .001). As the authors point out, having a high impact on HRQoL translates into patients having to stop their desired activities and having no good days in the week.

""This suggests that having RSsNP substantially adds to the activity limitation experienced by patients with COPD,"" they emphasize. The authors also found that RSsNP was significantly associated with poorer physical functioning after adjusting for COPD as reflected by SF-36v2 findings, again suggesting that patients who had COPD with concomitant RSsNP have an additional limitation in activity and a heavier symptom burden.

As Øie explained, rhinosinusitis has two clinical phenotypes: that with nasal polyps and that without nasal polyps, the latter being twice as prevalent. In fact, rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is associated with asthma, as she pointed out. Given, however, that rhinosinusitis without polyps is amenable to treatment with daily use of nasal steroids, it is possible to reduce the burden of symptoms and psychological stress associated with RSsNP in COPD.

Limitations of the study include the fact that investigators did not assess patients for the presence of any comorbidities that potentially could contribute to poorer HRQoL in this patient population.

The study was funded by Liaison Committee between the Central Norway Regional Health Authority and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

24,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963425,health,"Ohio Doctor Convicted of Prescribing Unnecessary Controlled Substances, Fraud

A federal jury found William R. Bauer, 84, of Port Clinton, Ohio, guilty of prescribing powerful controlled substances, including opioids, to patients without medical necessity and outside the usual course of medical practice.

Bauer, a neurologist with over 50 years of experience, was convicted of 76 counts of distribution of controlled substances and 25 counts of healthcare fraud. According to television station WTOL, a federal indictment from 2019 listed 270 charges against the physician.

Federal officials claim that through his practice in Bellevue, Ohio, Bauer repeatedly prescribed controlled substances, including oxycodone, fentanyl, morphine, and tramadol, outside the usual course of professional practice and without legitimate medical purpose. The charges focused on 14 of his patients, to whom he prescribed high doses of opioids and other controlled substances without medical necessity. He also prescribed dangerous drug combinations. He ignored patients' signs of addiction and abuse, such as early requests for refills, claims that medications had been lost, and claims that family members were stealing pills.

Bauer was also convicted of healthcare fraud for regularly administering epidural injections and trigger-point injections without medical necessity. Because these injections failed to meet the procedural requirements, they were rendered ineffective and were fraudulently billed to insurers. Bauer's illegal prescriptions resulted in insurers paying for these medically unnecessary controlled substances.

Evidence at trial indicated that between January 2007 and August 16, 2019, Bauer prescribed controlled substances outside the usual course of medical practice and for illegitimate medical purposes. Insurers paid for these medically unnecessary controlled substances as well.

He will be sentenced at a later date.

Lab Pays $1.2 Million to Resolve Allegations of False Claims for Drug Testing

Bluewater Toxicology, LLC, a clinical laboratory in Mount Washington, Kentucky, has agreed to pay $1.2 million to resolve civil allegations that it violated the False Claims Act.

The US Department of Justice alleged three issues relating to claims for urine drug testing services that Bluewater submitted to Medicare, Kentucky Medicaid, Indiana Medicaid, TRICARE, and CHAMPVA. First, Bluewater submitted claims in which it misrepresented the number of drug classes it tested. Bluewater claimed it conducted definitive urine drug tests of 22 or more drug classes. In truth, Bluewater tested for fewer than 22 drug classes and secured reimbursement for drug tests that it did not conduct.

Second, Bluewater submitted certain claims without sufficient documentation to support the physician's intent to order the test that was billed. In this way Bluewater obtained further unwarranted reimbursements.

Finally, Bluewater billed Medicare for specimen validity testing, a quality control process used to analyze a urine specimen to ensure that it has not been diluted or adulterated. Since January 2014, Medicare's guidance has stated that specimen validity testing should not be separately billed to Medicare, but Bluewater did so anyway.

Home Care Company Owner Pays $1 Million in Medicare Fraud Restitution

Richard Wennerberg, 72, of Grantham, New Hampshire, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two counts of class B felony Medicaid fraud, according to the New Hampshire Department of Justice.

Wennerberg is the owner of Alternative Care @ Home, LLC, a company licensed to provide in-home personal care services to Medicaid beneficiaries. He also pleaded guilty to a third charge of Medicaid fraud, through which Alternative Care @ Home, LLC, will be excluded from future participation in federal healthcare programs.

According to New Hampshire officials, Wennerberg submitted claims for reimbursement for in-home, personal care services that were never provided. Wennerberg billed Medicaid up to the maximum hours allowed under certain clients' service authorizations, knowing that his employees did not provide care for all of those hours. He would use the difference to reimburse some caregivers for mileage.

Wennerberg will serve 1 year in state prison and will pay $1 million in restitution.

North Carolina Wins Two ""Operation Root Canal"" Settlements

North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein announced two separate civil settlements with ProHealth Dental Inc and Henry W. Davis, Jr, DDS, as part of Operation Root Canal, an ongoing effort to find and stop healthcare fraud among dental practitioners. The settlements, totaling $75,000, resolve allegations of the submission of false claims to the North Carolina Medicaid program.

In Operation Root Canal, the state Medicaid investigations department reviews billing practices for a wide variety of dental services, including dental cleanings, use of nitrous oxide, repetitive restorations on the same tooth, palliative care, and upcoding of patient examinations. In total, the operation has netted more than $7 million for the state.

The recent settlement relates to a prior criminal plea the attorney general's Medicaid Investigations Division obtained involving Christian Ekberg, of Maryland, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for healthcare fraud and was ordered to pay $173,870.12 to the North Carolina Medicaid Fund in restitution. Ekberg was an officer and minority shareholder of ProHealth Dental, a company that entered into a practice management agreement with Henry W. Davis, Jr, DDS., a North Carolina dentist and Medicaid practitioner who provided dental services to patients living in skilled nursing facilities throughout North Carolina. ProHealth Dental would provide professional management services to Davis, including submitting Medicaid claims. The company submitted claims for dental services that Davis did not perform on Medicaid recipients.

25,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963395,health,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - In adults ages 55 to 64, a single flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening is associated with a substantial reduction in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, with a protective effective lasting up to 18 years, researchers say.

""The findings support the hypothesis of a plateau in the adenoma incidence in the distal colon at around age 60,"" Dr. Carlo Senore of University Hospital Città della Salute e della Scienza in Turin told Reuters Health by email. ""The strong protective effect of this screening modality can be explained by its ability to detect and excise all the lesions which might develop into invasive CRC.""

""Consistent with previous reports, our study confirms that the protective effect of a single FS screening is maintained up to 18 years,"" he said. ""The recommendation to repeat FS at five-to-10-year intervals should be revised, as the additional benefit of repeating the test is likely negligible, if any.""

""The benefit-to-harm ratio of this strategy would be improved when adopting a once-in-a-lifetime approach,"" he added, ""because of the substantial reduction in the burden associated with screening. as well as the reduction in healthcare costs.""

As reported in Annals of Internal Medicine, Dr. Senore and colleagues assessed CRC incidence and mortality over the long term after a single FS screening by analyzing data from a parallel randomized controlled trial in which patients from six centers in Italy were assigned to once-only FS or usual care.

Participants ages 55 to 64 were recruited from 1995 to 1999 and followed until 2012 (incidence) and 2014 to 2016 (mortality).

A total of 34,272 individuals were included in the analysis; 9,911 participants had screening in the intervention group. Median follow-up was 15.4 years for incidence and 18.8 years for mortality.

CRC incidence was reduced by 19% (rate ratio, 0.81) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, and by 33% (RR, 0.67) in the per protocol (PP) analysis.

Similarly, CRC mortality was reduced by 22% (RR, 0.78) in the ITT analysis and by 39% (RR, 0.61) in the PP analysis.

CRC incidence was significantly reduced among both men and women, but CRC mortality was significantly reduced only among men (ITT RR, 0.73), not among women (ITT RR, 0.90).

Further, the incidence of distal CRC was significantly reduced by 30% (RR, 0.70) overall, whereas no effect was noted for proximal CRC (RR, 1.03).

The authors state, ""Although its protective effect for proximal CRC is limited, the 30% reduction in overall CRC risk represents a milestone that can be achieved in the general population with sustainable costs and equity. Promoting integration with primary prevention interventions would further increase the preventive effect of FS screening.""

Dr. Michael Bretthauer of the University of Oslo and University of Tromso in Norway, coauthor of a related editorial, commented in an email to Reuters Health, ""With this trial, all four large-scale RCTs worldwide have now been concluded; a 20-year era is over.""

""Based on these findings, the current guideline recommendation of repeating sigmoidoscopy every five years may be extended to longer intervals, reducing costs and burden,"" he said. ""A caveat is that the effects are larger in men as compared to women, so I'm not sure if this screening test is best for women.""

26,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963327,health,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - In major metropolitan areas with transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) programs, poorer neighborhoods and those with more Black and Hispanic people have lower rates of the minimally invasive surgery, a new study finds.

An analysis of Medicare data from 7,590 zip codes revealed that even after adjusting for socioeconomic markers, age and clinical comorbidities, rates of TAVR remained lower in zip codes with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic patients, researchers report in JAMA Cardiology.

""Even when patients have geographic access to TAVR, there appear to be inequities in access to the procedure among Black, Hispanic and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients,"" said lead author Dr. Ashwin Nathan of the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia.

""The etiology for inequities in access are likely multifactorial,"" Dr. Nathan told Reuters Health by email. ""TAVR is the last step in a complex and multistep diagnostic/referral pathway that starts with health maintenance in a primary-care office, and includes subspecialty referral, multiple imaging and diagnostic tests and ultimate referral for TAVR. Where the 'lesion' is in this pathway that is causing inequities in access needs to be studied more so that solutions can be developed to address the inequity.""

To take a closer look at whether there were racial and ethnic disparities in receipt of TAVR in metro areas where centers offering the procedure would be relatively close to where patients lived, Dr. Nathan and his colleagues turned to the Medicare Hospital Data Claims and Demographic Data files.

The researchers focused on core-based statistical areas (CBSAs), which are defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget as distinct geographic areas consisting of an urban center and surrounding counties that are socioeconomically linked to the urban center. Dr. Nathan and his colleagues found that within the 25 largest CBSAs with TAVR programs between 2012 and 2018, there were 7,590 individual zip codes.

The median rate of TAVR per 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries in those CBSAs was 249. Unadjusted rates of TAVR per 100,000 beneficiaries were lower among Black and Hispanic patients compared with white patients across each tertile of median household income.

When the researchers divided zip codes into tertiles by markers of socioeconomic status, age-adjusted rates of TAVR were significantly higher in zip codes with higher median incomes compared with lower median incomes (317.5 vs. 170 per 100,000). Similarly, age-adjusted rates of TAVR were significantly higher in the zip codes with the lowest proportion of patients dually eligible for Medicaid compared with those with the highest proportion (310 vs. 178.5 per 100,000).

Dr. Nathan and his colleagues found that for each $1,000 decrease in median household income, the number of TAVR procedures performed per 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries was 0.2% lower. For each 1% increase in the proportion of patients who were dually eligible for Medicaid services, the number of TAVR procedures performed per 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries was 2.1% lower.

Rates of TAVR were significantly lower in zip codes with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic patients, even after adjusting for socioeconomic markers, age and clinical comorbidities.

""We have a responsibility as a medical community to ensure equitable access to life-saving procedures such as TAVR,"" Dr. Nathan said. ""It is imperative that we take action to remedy the inequities found in this project.""

The new study ""raises awareness,"" said Dr. Gilbert Tang, surgical director of the structural heart program at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City.

""What we don't know is whether there are other non-identifiable factors that lead to this discrepancy,"" Dr. Tang said. Even an area with a high density of centers, patients still may have difficulties traveling to a center, he added.

""Elderly patients, for example, might need help getting to a medical center to get treatment or evaluation for TAVR,"" Dr. Tang said. ""Evaluation can be quite extensive and taxing to these patients. We see some families who can't bring a family member in for evaluation without taking time off work. Or they may have to find childcare.""

Those types of factors won't be captured in a database, Dr. Tang said. ""I don't think you can pinpoint race as the only reason some patients are not getting therapy,"" he added. ""It might just be a marker for something more complex.""

27,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963328,health,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The Clean Cut quality-improvement program can help make surgeries safer, a study from Ethiopia suggests.

Lifebox Foundation's checklist-based Clean Cut program aims to improve anesthesia safety, reduce surgical infection rates, and strengthen surgical teamwork.

""The improvements in surgical safety seen as a result of the Lifebox Clean Cut program in Ethiopia were sustained between 6 and 18 months after completion of the intervention, suggesting these changes in surgical culture and practice are long-lasting,"" said Dr. Nichole Starr of the University of California, San Francisco, who worked on the study.

""The findings of sustainable improvements in surgical safety practices over time are not surprising but are reassuring that our collaborative work is making a lasting impact,"" she told Reuters Health by email.

Dr. Starr and her colleagues investigated the sustainability of the Clean Cut program introduced at eight hospitals in Ethiopia.

Over four years, surgical teams and hospital management staff in the program engaged in six key practices:

- Skin antisepsis of the surgeon's hands and surgical site

- Sterile-field maintenance of gowns, drapes, and gloves

- Confirmation of instrument sterility

- Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis

- Gauze count before and after each case

- Adherence to World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist

During the program, the research team monitored infection-prevention practices, process mapping, training, and action planning. Then, six to 18 months after the program ended, for 14 days in seven of the hospitals, they observed and evaluated how well the hospitals maintained the program's practices. Evaluators observed all operations in the same operating rooms and used the same Clean Cut data collection tool they had used during the program.

Overall, 738 patients were enrolled before the Clean Cut program began, 2,178 were enrolled after the program began, and 469 took part during the sustainability audit. The case urgency between the groups was similar.

Compared with the program period, the audit period showed increased compliance with surgical-safety-checklist use (50% vs. 58%, respectively), skin antisepsis (58% vs. 75%), antibiotic prophylaxis (59% vs. 66%), and gauze counting (94% vs. 95%).

Compliance decreased over time with surgical-linen integrity and sterility (46% vs. 39%) and instrument sterility (55% vs. 42%), but remained far above baseline (6% and 8%, respectively).

On multivariable analysis, the results were not linked with differences in case volume by hospital, age, or procedure type.

""Ownership creation among hospitals was a strength of the study,"" co-author Dr. Natnael Gebeyehu of St Peters Specialized Hospital in Addis Ababa told Reuters Health by email. ""All solutions were designed by the hospitals' team members themselves.""

The authors acknowledge limitations to the study, including the lack of functioning autoclaves and biomedical engineering expertise needed to maintain them.

""Surgical-quality-improvement projects in low-income settings are increasingly commonplace and are gaining more recognition as important interventions to improve surgical care in all types of global settings,"" Dr. Starr said.

""We do not always have the opportunity to measure impacts over time,"" she explained. ""However, it is important to demonstrate that gains in safety are not transient or reliant on external influences.""

""The changes in surgical culture as a result of Clean Cut may have lasting positive effects on patient care, substantially reducing their risk of infections after surgery. We estimate that over 80,000 patients in Ethiopia have been impacted by the Clean Cut program to date."" Dr. Starr noted, adding that Clean Cut programs are also operating in Liberia and Madagascar.

28,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963402,health,"(Reuters) - Nearly everyone who had a mild case of COVID-19 still has antibodies to the coronavirus a year later, but that might not protect them from new variants circulating now, a small study suggests.

Among 43 Australians who dealt with mild COVID-19 early in the pandemic, 90% still had antibodies 12 months later. But only 51.2% had antibodies that showed neutralizing activity against the original version of the virus and only 44.2% had antibodies that could neutralize the early Alpha variant, the research team at the University of Adelaide reported on medRxiv ahead of peer review.

Neutralizing antibodies against the now-dominant and highly transmissible Delta variant were seen in only 16.2%, with 11.6% against Gamma, and against Beta in only 4.6%.

Survivors of mild COVID-19 ""are vulnerable to infection with circulating and newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants 12 months after recovery,"" the researchers said.

The findings ""reinforce the potential benefit"" of tailoring vaccine boosters to currently circulating variants, similar to how annual flu vaccines are tailored to current influenza strains, they said.

When they analyzed results from eight of the studies in detail, they saw a 53% reduction in the incidence of COVID-19 with mask wearing and a 25% reduction with physical distancing.

There is not yet enough data to confirm the overall benefits of more stringent measures such as lockdowns, school and workplace closures, and border closures, the researchers reported in The BMJ.

Very few of the studies analyzed were randomized trials, so they cannot prove the interventions directly reduced infection rates.

Researchers analyzed infection rates in citizens returning to Israel through Ben-Gurion airport, for whom PCR tests upon arrival are required regardless of vaccination status.

""Surprisingly,"" in August 2021, the rate of positive tests among vaccinated travelers was more than double the rate among the unvaccinated, said Retsef Levi of the MIT Sloan School of Management, coauthor of a report posted on the SSRN server ahead of peer review.

Travelers who had received the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine within the past six months or who had received a booster dose were considered vaccinated. The group considered to be unvaccinated included the never-vaccinated and those whose most recent shot was more than six months prior, given evidence of waning vaccine efficacy by then.

In September, when the Israeli government was recommending booster shots for all adults, the positive-test rate dropped among vaccinated travelers and was about 3.5 times lower with vaccination than without. But by October, the positive-test rate in the vaccinated group, while still lower, had started to climb again, Levi said.

The data suggest that limiting frequent COVID-19 testing to unvaccinated people would ""pose potential risks by reinforcing the misrepresentation that vaccinated individuals are protected from infections,"" he said.

Venetoclax treatment combinations show benefit as first-line and follow-up therapy for adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as patients who relapse after receiving allogeneic stem cell transplants.

Why This Matters

Failure of conventional induction chemotherapy and posttransplant relapse are key challenges in AML, with limited therapeutic options, particularly for the elderly and patients with comorbidities.

Venetoclax combinations are currently approved in the US only for first-line treatment of AML in adults aged 75 years or older who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy.

The new findings suggest broader benefits, perhaps even an improved chance at a second transplant if the first fails.

Study Design

The study was a single-center review of 56 adults (mean age, 66.5 years) who were either treatment naive or had relapsed or recurrent disease. They were treated with venetoclax combined with either hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine in 28-day cycles.

Eighteen patients received first-line therapy, 23 were treated after failure with conventional induction chemotherapy, and 15 were treated after relapse from stem cell transplant. Median follow-up was 4.7 months.

Key Results

In the first-line setting, median overall survival from the start of venetoclax treatment was 13.3 months, and the overall response rate was 61.1%.

Overall survival was 5 months, and overall response rate was 52.2% in subsequent lines.

Following transplant relapse, overall survival was 4 months, and overall response rate was 42.8%. Among patients who underwent a subsequent transplant, median overall survival was 11.5 months from the start of venetoclax treatment.

Nine patients who carried FLT3-ITD mutations had lower overall survival rates with a median of 3.4 months compared to 10.4 months for patients without FLT3-ITD mutations. Patients with NPM1 or IDH1/2 mutations showed a survival advantage.

Although not statistically significant, venetoclax doses higher than 100 mg were associated with a greater likelihood of complete remission.

Limitations

The study was retrospective and was carried out at a single academic center, with only a small number of patients and no comparator group.

Disclosures

There was no commercial funding, and the investigators had no conflicts of interest.

32,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963396,health,"(Reuters) - COVID-19 is generally less severe in vaccinated patients but that does not mean breakthrough infections will be benign, a large study shows.

Researchers analyzed data collected by the U.S. Veterans Affairs Administration from 16,035 survivors of breakthrough infections, 48,536 unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors and nearly 3.6 million uninfected people.

At six months after infection, after taking their risk factors into account, people with breakthrough infections had lower rates of death and long-term lingering health problems than COVID-19 patients who had not been vaccinated. But compared to people who never had COVID-19, those who had breakthrough infections had a 53% higher risk of death and a 59% higher risk of having at least one new medical condition, particularly problems affecting the lungs and other organs.

Even when breakthrough infections did not require hospitalization, the increased risks of death and lasting effects were ""not trivial,"" the research team reported in a paper posted on Research Square ahead of peer review.

34,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963325,health,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - For multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), initial therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) plus infliximab is associated with better outcomes than IVIG alone, according to new study.

Children treated with IVIG plus infliximab were less apt to need additional therapy, had better cardiac outcomes, a more rapid decline in C-reactive protein and left the intensive-care unit sooner than peers given IVIG only, report researchers from the University of Colorado and Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora.

The best treatment for MIS-C, a hyper-inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection, remains unclear. Adding methylprednisolone to IVIG as initial treatment may improve outcomes, but less is known about adding infliximab, Dr. Lyndsey Cole and colleagues note in Pediatrics.

They took a look back at 72 children with MIS-C who were treated with IVIG alone or with infliximab at their center.

The primary outcome was need for additional therapy 24 hours or more after treatment initiation.

Additional therapy was needed in 13 of 20 (65%) children who received IVIG alone versus 16 of 52 (31%) who received IVIG plus infliximab (P=0.01).

Median time spent in the ICU was 3.3 days with IVIG alone versus only 1.8 days with IVIG plus infliximab (P=0.001).

""Importantly, our study revealed improved cardiac outcomes in patients who received IVIG plus infliximab,"" the researchers write.

New or worsened left ventricular dysfunction developed in four of 20 (20%) children given IVIG only versus two of 52 (4%) given IVIG with infliximab (P=0.05) and new vasoactive-medication requirement developed in three of 20 (15%) and two of 52 (4%), respectively (P=0.13).

Twenty-four hours after treatment, there was no change in CRP levels in the IVIG-only group compared with a 46% median decline in the IVIG plus infliximab group; at 48 hours, median declines were 5% and 70%, respectively (P<0.001).

There was no significant difference in hospital length of stay, time to fever resolution, vasoactive-medication duration or need for diuretics.

Summing up, the researchers say this retrospective study shows improvement in several outcomes with initial intensified therapy consisting of IVIG plus infliximab.

The researchers say limitations of their study include the single-center, retrospective, observational design. Also, they did not perform propensity-score matching because of the small sample size and relative similarity between groups.

Because there is no definitive diagnostic test, some patients who did not have MIS-C might have been included. However, only patients who met the CDC MIS-C case definition were included, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the cohort were similar to those previously reported.

""Future randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm these findings and to compare initial therapy with IVIG alone, IVIG plus infliximab, and IVIG plus corticosteroids. Comparative effectiveness trials, which may be more feasible, may also provide insight into optimal initial MIS-C therapy,"" the study team says.

The study had no external funding and the authors indicate no relevant disclosures.

35,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963321,health,"(Reuters) - Florida on Thursday banned schools and businesses from requiring vaccination against COVID-19 and set the stage for a possible withdrawal from the federal agency aimed at protecting workplace safety.

Governor Ron DeSantis, a right-wing Republican widely believed to be planning a run for the U.S. presidency, signed the new laws in a community called Brandon, the same name used as a euphemism for a coarse epithet in a chant against Democratic President Joe Biden.

""We're making sure that people have a right to earn a living, people have a right to have protections at their place of employment and that parents have protections to be able to direct the upbringing of their kids,"" said DeSantis.

In a later announcement of the bills' signing on Twitter, DeSantis referred to ""the free state of Florida.""

Echoing anti-vaccine rhetoric, DeSantis repeated a misleading claim that vaccines do not protect against coronavirus infections, and said ""natural immunities"" should qualify people to return to in-person work.

The bills drew immediate condemnation from public health officials and Democratic leaders.

""Gee,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote on Twitter. ""What could go wrong...""

The bills were passed in a three-day special session of the Republican-dominated Florida legislature called by DeSantis with the goal of thwarting coronavirus vaccine mandates imposed by the federal government as well as by private employers and school districts.

The laws allow employers to ask employees to become vaccinated, but also require them to allow people to opt out for religious, health and other reasons. People who previously had COVID-19 would be exempt despite evidence the vaccines provide greater protection against reinfection as well as serious cases that require hospitalization.

Employers who refuse to allow the exemptions can be fined up to $50,000 per violation. The new laws also ban government entities from requiring vaccinations. Schools districts may not require vaccinations or ask teachers and students to wear masks.

The laws also ban school districts from requiring otherwise healthy students who have been exposed to COVID-19 to quarantine before returning to class.

The legislature also directed the governor's office to develop a plan to set up the state's own agency for the protection of workers, which would replace the authority of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

Florida is among several conservative states suing the federal agency to stop it from enforcing the Biden administration's vaccine mandate.

About 61,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Florida, the third-most-populous U.S. state, although new cases have decreased dramatically there in recent weeks as the summer surge ebbed."
36,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963319,health,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch healthcare officials said on Friday they have begun delaying operations for some cancer and heart patients to free up space in intensive care units during a record wave of COVID-19 infections.

""These are cancer patients that should actually be operated on within six weeks of diagnosis, and that won't be met in all cases. It's also heart patients,"" said a spokesperson for LCPS, the national organisation that allocates hospital resources.

""It's horrible, of course, for the patients.""

The National Institute for Health (RIVM) reported a record of more than 23,000 new cases in the previous 24 hours on Thursday, compared with the previous daily high of around 13,000 reached in December 2020.

With 85% of the adult population vaccinated, both hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates have so far remained lower than they were at the height of the initial wave in April 2020, although there is a delay between the date of infection and the date of admission to hospital.

With fewer than 200 beds remaining in Dutch ICU as of Thursday, hospitals are scrambling to add more capacity.

The government at the start of November reintroduced mask-wearing in stores, and last weekend it reimposed a partial lockdown, including closing bars and restaurants after 8 p.m.

But the impact of those measures has yet to be seen in the daily case numbers.

Parliament is divided over a plan proposed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government to limit access to indoor public venues to people who have a ""corona pass"", which shows they have been vaccinated or already recovered from an infection. Critics say the move would be divisive and discriminatory.

Schools remain open, and virologists on Thursday proposed extending Christmas holidays to slow infections, which are rising most rapidly among children."
37,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963414,health,"The rate of U.S. hospitalizations for three types of serious infections in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) appears to have declined from 2012 to 2017, according to research presented at the virtual annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology.

Several of the standard treatments for PsA have an increased risk of infections, but the rates vary amongst conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), glucocorticoids, biologics, and other therapies.

""Given the uptake of biological therapies has increased over recent years, we sought to investigate the national trends in serious infections in patients with psoriatic arthritis from the years 2012 to 2017,"" Vagishwari Murugesan, MBBS, a psoriatic arthritis clinical fellow at the University of Toronto, told attendees in a prerecorded poster presentation. Murugesan was a fellow at Boston University when she conducted the research.

The researchers analyzed data from 2012 to 2017 in the U.S. National Inpatient Sample (NIS), which includes approximately 20% of all discharges from U.S. community hospitals except rehabilitation and long-term acute care institutions. Using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, the researchers identified all discharge records containing a diagnosis of PsA as well as pneumonia, sepsis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and skin and soft-tissue infections. After making adjustments to match U.S. population age distributions over the years, they examined trends in serious infections among patients with PsA for that 6-year period.

Demographics over those years changed little: The average age of discharged patients was 59.5 in 2012 and 60.8 in 2017. Similarly, the patient population was 56% women and 88.5% Whites in 2012 and 57.7% women and 88.4% Whites in 2017. The average length of stay was also similar: 4.7 days in 2012, compared with 4.9 days in 2017.

Among 50,700 discharges of patients with PsA in 2012, the researchers identified 125 with pneumonia, 230 with sepsis, 312 with skin and soft-tissue infections, and 174 with a UTI. Among the 179,400 discharges in 2017 of patients with PsA, 344 had pneumonia, 374 had sepsis, 681 had skin and soft-tissue infections, and 348 had a UTI. After statistical analysis, the researchers found no significant differences in pneumonia diagnoses during the years studied, but they did find a statistically significant decline in sepsis, skin and soft tissue infections, and UTI discharges (P < .001).

A notable limitation of the study is the NIS database’s lack of data on treatments or outpatient data, making it impossible to determine if more infections were occurring but simply being treated in outpatient settings, although it’s not clear why such a substantial shift would occur in just 5 years. It’s also possible that coding practices differ across hospital, but, presumably, the ways they might differ in 2012 would be similar to any differences in 2017.

Arthur Kavanaugh, MD, a professor of medicine and director of the Center for Innovative Therapy at the University of California, San Diego, found the results interesting for what he considers an important topic.

""What makes these data interesting is the same thing that limits their reliability: The authors note that infections decreased 'despite the increase in use of biologics over this time,’ "" Kavanaugh said in an interview. ""These are claims data, so there is no way to support any association between those serious infections and biologic use. Indeed, multiple factors could have also impacted these data. It is not possible to tell from claims data.""

Kavanaugh said the question is worth investigating further with data from other sources.

The research was funded by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. One study coauthor reported ties to UCB; Murugesan and her other coauthors reported no disclosures. Kavanaugh had no disclosures.

38,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963412,health,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved vosoritide (Voxzogo) daily injection for the treatment of children with achondroplasia, the most common form of human dwarfism.

The indication is for children aged 5 years and older who have achondroplasia and open epiphyses (growth plates), meaning that they still have the potential to grow.

Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene that leads to inhibited mineralization of chondrocytes (cartilage cells) in the growth plate.

The mutation occurs in about 25,00 live births worldwide, resulting in disproportionately short stature and disordered architecture of the long bones, spine, face, and base of the skull. Affected children have an average-sized torso, short arms and legs, and an enlarged head.

Vosoritide, a biologic analogue of C-type natriuretic peptide, prevents the inhibition of mineralization of chondrocytes caused by the FGFR3 mutation.

""Today's approval fulfils an unmet medical need for more than 10,000 children in the United States.... With this action, children with short stature due to achondroplasia have a treatment option that targets the underlying cause of their short stature,"" said Theresa Kehoe, MD, director of the Division of General Endocrinology in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a statement.

Lynda Polgreen, MD, an investigator in clinical trials for vosoritide, agrees: ""This approval is an important milestone representing the first time that physicians will be able to offer a therapy targeted at the root cause of the condition for families of children with achondroplasia aged five and older,"" she noted in a BioMarin press release.

""Achondroplasia is a lifelong genetic condition resulting from the disordered skeletal architecture caused by impaired endochondral bone growth throughout childhood,"" added Polgreen, of the Lundquist Institute at Harbor and associate professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angelas.

The approval was based on data from a year-long, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study in 121 children aged 5–17 years with open epiphyses. The patients were randomly assigned to receive injections of vosoritide or placebo. Those who received the drug grew an average of 1.57 cm (0.6 in.) taller compared to the control patients.

The most common side effects were injection site reactions, vomiting, and reduced blood pressure. These reactions are listed on the label as a warning and a precaution.

Vosoritide was approved under FDA's accelerated approval pathway, which allows for earlier approval of drugs to treat serious conditions and that fill an unmet medical need. Such approvals are based on surrogate or intermediary endpoints. The company will now be required to conduct a postmarketing study to assess final adult height.

""We applaud the FDA for recognizing the urgent unmet medical need for this progressive condition. As a parent of a child with achondroplasia, I see the availability of treatments that impact bone growth as an important step forward,"" said Amer Haider, co-founder of Growing Stronger, an organization with a mission to improve the quality of medical care for little people through supporting research, in the company press release.

Growing Stronger raises nonprofit donations that are granted to researchers focused on dwarfism.

Vosoritide is expected to be available in the United States by mid- to late-December, and BioMarin will begin the promotion of it immediately.

The product was approved by the European Commission in August 2021, and marketing authorization reviews are in process in Japan, Brazil, and Australia. Approvals may be granted in these countries in 2022.

39,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963409,health,"NEW ORLEANS — Leaders of the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) are seeing signs of hope that their profession will become more ethnically and racially diverse despite decades of slow progress.

Dr Tamara Fountain

Subspeciality groups have formed task forces seeking to make ophthalmologists more representative of the population they serve, and the AAO's 5-year-old mentorship program for underrepresented groups has received an infusion of donations in the past year, said AAO President Tamara Fountain, MD.

These efforts may not yet be reflected in the statistics on race and ethnicity — which are among the worst of any US medical specialty — but they are providing crucial encouragement, she told Medscape Medical News.

""It's touched a groundswell of people who have felt marginalized in our workforce, in our training programs, who come to these Academy meetings and realize there's something for them, that we, this behemoth of a medical organization devoted to eye care, is speaking to them and is looking out for them and providing the support that they need,"" she said.

Fountain was one of 18 panelists who spoke here at a symposium devoted to diversity, equity, and inclusion at the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 2021 Annual Meeting.

One by one, speakers displayed slides demonstrating the stark underrepresentation of most ethnic groups in ophthalmology.

Together, Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander people made up only 6% of practicing ophthalmologists in 2015, according to a JAMA ophthalmology study cited by Basil Williams, MD, assistant professor of ophthalmology at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio.

That contrasted not only to the 30.7% share of these groups in the total US population that year but also to their proportion among ophthalmology residents (7.7%) and medical students (16.4%). The study also found that these numbers had barely budged in a decade. Citing an article in Ophthalmology that she co-authored, Kristen Nwanyanwu, MD, MBA, said that university ophthalmology departments are the third least diverse among all US medical specialties.

Dr Angela Elam

""The numbers you have shown are dismal, just dismal,"" said panelist Terri L. Young, MD, MBA, the chair of the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. ""Folks are getting different compensation schedules. They're given different resources. They're given different leadership opportunities. They're certainly not getting the proper coaching for promotion.""

The lack of ophthalmologists from the underrepresented groups has consequences for patient care, said Angela R. Elam, MD, assistant professor of ophthalmology at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor.

Racial and ethnic minorities are at greater risk of losing vision from eye disease, she said, citing an article she coauthored in Survey of Ophthalmology. In part, this is due to income, she said. For example, people enrolled in Medicaid receive less glaucoma care than people enrolled in commercial health plans.

But even after controlling for other socioeconomic factors, the disparities between Black and White patients remain. For example, Black patients are more likely than White patients to undergo enucleation or evisceration after eye trauma, Elam said.

Jayanth Sridhar, MD, associate professor of clinical ophthalmology at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami, Florida, who has researched diversity in ophthalmology, said several explanations have been proposed for glaucoma's weak track record compared to other medical specialties.

First, many people from underrepresented backgrounds think of primary care as an obvious way to contribute to their communities, he told Medscape Medical News.

Second, many medical schools don't include ophthalmology rotations, so students don't consider it as an option for their residencies. Third, more than in other specialties, ophthalmologists are exposed to the specialty because someone in their family is an ophthalmologist.

Finally, ophthalmology is a competitive specialty, with more students applying relative to the number of residencies than the average specialty, said Sridhar, who was not part of the symposium.

""When it comes to applying and matching in a competitive field, you may not be prepared,"" he said. ""You did not get the sufficient mentorship. You didn't start doing the shadowing and research early on, you didn't go and find out the ophthalmologists at your institution. So you're kind of behind the eight ball.""

The AAO is attempting to address the problem in conjunction with the Association of University Professors of Ophthalmology through its program Minority Ophthalmology Mentoring, Fountain said. Founded in 2016, the program matches medical students to ophthalmologists and provides support and training programs to the students. It has grown rapidly in recent years, doubling in size to 50 students from 2019 to 2020. Its budget is $297,459 for 2021.

Keith Warren, MD, who has a private retina specialty practice, said it troubles him that he is the only Black American ophthalmologist in Kansas City, Missouri. A decade ago, he brought up the problem to leadership at the American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) but got little response, he told Medscape Medical News.

Then the COVID-19 pandemic made many people more aware of disparities in healthcare, and incidents of police brutality that were publicized in 2020 put a spotlight on racism. So he wrote an article in the ASRS publication Retina Times, calling for new efforts to diversify the subspecialty. This time the leadership asked him to form an ad hoc committee, which is looking for ways to address the problem.

One idea: mentorship ""families"" in which ophthalmologists at all stages of their careers mentor each other. For example, the younger members in each group can offer advice about new technology to the older ones, while the older ones provide career advice.

Warren draws encouragement from changes at the top of the AAO, as well. Both Fountain and the organization's CEO, Stephen D. McLeod, MD, are Black. Warren is pleased that the US Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 exam will become pass-fail starting January 26, 2022, because some studies have found the test to be biased against people from underrepresented groups.

White ophthalmologists have a role to play as well, Warren said. The first ophthalmologist to encourage him in the career was his mother's doctor, a White man.

And sometimes it's a matter of creating a safe space where people from underrepresented backgrounds can express their views. ""Part of safety is listening,"" he said. ""It is compassion. You have to understand that ultimately, it's going to benefit you because you would have employees that can bring things to the table that you might not have heard otherwise. Your patient population could certainly expand if you have a diverse workforce.""

As she stepped down from the podium after the symposium, Fountain was greeted by Harry Levine, a medical student from Mexico who is studying at the University of Miami, Florida. ""Every time I see something like this it is reassures me that I'm picking the right career,"" he told her. ""People on the top care for minorities and we're valued. It's gratifying to see that.""

""That's one example of why I'm optimistic,"" Fountain said.

40,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963403,health,"The crystalline clarity with which smartphones can now capture images has been put to another innovative use: monitoring patients who've undergone emergency abdominal surgery for surgical-site infections (SSIs) and allowing physicians to diagnose them earlier in the postoperative period before they morph into a much bigger problem.

""Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, there have been big changes in how care after surgery is delivered,"" Kenneth McLean, MBChB, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, observed in a statement.

""Patients and staff have become used to having remote consultations and we've shown we can effectively and safely monitor wounds after surgery while patients recover at home — this is likely to become the new normal,"" he added.

""Recovery can be an anxious time for everybody and these approaches provide reassurance,"" senior author Ewen Harrison, PhD, professor of surgery and data science, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, added in the same statement.

""We hope that picking up wound problems early can result in treatments that limit complications,"" he added.

The study was published online November 18, 2021, in npj Digital Medicine.

TWIST Trial

A total of 492 patients were enrolled in the TWIST trial, the majority of whom had undergone major surgical procedures, almost three-quarters of them being done laparoscopically. Some 223 patients were randomized to the smartphone intervention, while the remaining 269 patients were randomized to routine care. Patients in the smartphone group were contacted on days 3, 7, and 15 postoperatively and directed to an online site where they were asked about their wound and any symptoms they were experiencing.

If symptomatic, they were then asked to take a picture of their wound and upload it to a secure website where a member of the surgical team would assess the photographs along with the patient's responses for signs of wound infection. Patients were followed for 30 days after surgery to document whether they had subsequently been diagnosed with an SSI.

Routine-care patients were simply contacted 30 days after surgery to see whether or not they had been diagnosed with an infection. ""Overall 8.3%...of the cohort developed surgical-site infections (SSI) in the 30-day postoperative period, with no significant difference in the SSI rate between the trial arms,"" investigators report: at 9.4% in the smartphone arm and 7.4% in routine-care arm (P = .513).

However, the mean time-to-diagnosis of the SSI — the primary endpoint of the trial — was numerically shorter, at 9.3 days in the smartphone group versus 11.8 days in the routine-care group, although this difference again was not statistically significant. On the other hand, a post-hoc analysis showed that patients issued a smartphone were almost four times more likely to have their SSI diagnosed in the first 7 postoperative days, at an odds ratio (OR) of 3.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 - 13.51; P = .043) compared with those assigned to routine care.

""These surgical wound infections typically worsen over time and can spread into the blood stream or deeper into the abdomen if left untreated,"" McLean explained in an email to Medscape Medical News. ""So if we can diagnose these infections before they become more pronounced, we can potentially avoid these more serious complications and the need for re-admissions."" The wound assessment tool also had a high negative predictive value — ""meaning that an SSI could be ruled out with confidence,"" as the authors stress.

Indeed, of the patients diagnosed with an SSI within the smartphone group, over one-third had used the tool 48 hours prior to diagnosis — five were diagnosed on the same day — and all of the infections that were identified were based on patient-reported symptoms. ""Incorporation of wound images offered a significant improvement to specificity from 84.4% (95% CI, 80.5 - 88.3%) to 93.6% (95% CI, 90.9 - 96.2%),"" the investigators add.

Researchers also compared the use of healthcare services between the two treatment groups. Overall, 14.3% of those who used a smartphone contacted a healthcare service — either community or hospital services — about their wound. This compared with 22.3% of patients in the routine-care group. Patients in the smartphone group also had 43% lower rates of needing community-care services, at an OR of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.34 - 0.94; P = .577), although their need for hospital emergency services was similar to that required by routine-care patients.

And in a comparison of the 30-day patient experience, those in the smartphone group reported significantly more positive experiences on all of the measures assessed, including access to care, ease of access to advice, and the quality of the advice received.

Some Did Not Use the Tool

The authors acknowledge that roughly one-third of those assigned to the smartphone assessment tool did not use the tool at all. However, as McLean pointed out, there will always be a proportion of patients who are less likely to use a service if they feel there's no need for it — their wound was healing well, for example — so why bother? ""Reassuringly,"" he added, ""there was no evidence that, for example, older patients with smartphones were less likely to use the tool,"" he said.

The authors also pointed out that there are broader applications for the use of smartphones in the delivery of healthcare. For example, the remote follow-up approach could be expanded to encompass other potential complications after surgery. It could also be used to monitor chronic wounds like diabetic ulcers or other chronic conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

""Delays to access to appropriate emergency healthcare, as well as unnecessary healthcare attendances, can lead to harm for patients and add more burden on healthcare services,"" McLean said.

""By increasing the access of patients to advice, they are more likely to receive the right treatment at the right time and further work is currently underway to explore how they can be tailored to make [care] as accessible and inclusive as possible,"" he added.

Rapid Adoption

Asked to comment on the findings, Josh Totty, MD, NIHR Clinical Lecturer in Plastic Surgery, Hull York Medical School, United Kingdom, noted that the way in which technology is used has changed significantly over the past 2 years.

""The rapid adoption of technology in healthcare, using powerful computers that the majority of people have access to in their pockets, has meant that patients and clinicians could be kept safe and risks reduced, productivity increased and patients have easier access to their clinicians,"" he told Medscape Medical News in an email.

As we move on from the pandemic, Totty added, ""we are constantly looking for ways of improving care that are acceptable to patients,"" he said.

""And this study shows that smartphones might help diagnose significant infections earlier in the disease process. In turn, earlier treatment potentially leads to better outcomes and less morbidity as a result,"" Totty added. He also said that the study was both important and well designed and adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that smartphones have a crucial role to play in the way patients access healthcare.

And he emphasized, ""Work now needs to be undertaken to ensure that everyone, young and old, wealthy or poor, has access to this technology.""

41,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963392,health,"Some patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) don't respond well enough even to ""quartet therapy,"" the combination of drugs from four separate classes recommended as first-line agents to be initiated early after the diagnosis. A member of yet another drug class, tentatively envisioned as second- or third-line option in such cases, may offer a novel side benefit beyond the primary effect on mortality or HFrEF events seen in a large phase-3 trial.

The investigational agent, omecamtiv mecarbil (Cytokinetics), may also cut the risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke in such patients, suggests a new secondary analysis of the GALACTIC-HF trial, which randomly assigned both inpatients and outpatients with the chronic disease.

The stroke benefit may have been the result, in part, of another finding, reduced risk for new-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF/AFl) in the patients assigned to the drug, described as a myosin activator.

The results support omecamtiv mecarbil as ""an exciting potential new approach to decreasing the risk of stroke in patients with HFrEF,"" said John R. Teerlink, MD, University of California San Francisco and San Francisco VA Medical Center, presenting the results November 13 during the virtual American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2021.

""If there's one thing I think is the most exciting part about this, that's it,"" Teerlink told theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology. Such patients who develop AF would likely go on oral anticoagulation, ""but if there's a way to improve their risk of stroke without having to use an anticoagulant, that's actually, to me, really quite compelling.""

The findings certainly aren't conclusive; although strokes were prospectively defined and adjudicated in GALACTIC-HF, they weren't part of the primary endpoint, Teerlink cautioned.

""Omecamtiv mecarbil should not be part of the four pillars. It did not save lives,"" he said, in reference to the quartet therapy consisting of an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), a beta blocker, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), and an SGLT2 inhibitor.

But evidence is sufficient to say that omecamtiv mecarbil, if it is approved, ""should be added in patients with left ventricular ejection fractions less than 35% who are on, or are in the process of being put on, the four pillars,"" he said. ""I think it's appropriate for it to be the first of the second tier.""

Fewer Strokes ""Makes Sense""

As previously reported, patients in GALACTIC-HF assigned to the drug showed a modest but significant 8% decline in risk for the trial's primary endpoint, heart failure-related events or CV death over a median 22 months.

In the current analysis, those taking omecamtiv mecarbil also benefited with a 35% drop in risk for a first fatal or nonfatal stroke, compared with the control group; the risk of fatal strokes fell by 44%.

The findings ""make sense"" given other apparent effects of the drug observed in its trials, including less new-onset AF/AFl and signs of reverse remodeling, observed Stephen J. Greene, MD, Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, North Carolina.

""I think the jury is still out, and more research needed to solidify the stroke-reduction issue,"" he said when interviewed. ""But it seems to be a very strong signal at the very least.""

Stroke is a very relevant endpoint in heart failure, ""and not something that gets a lot of focus in heart failure trials,"" said Greene, who is not a co-author on the GALACTIC-HF publication. So, for omecamtiv mecarbil, it's at least ""a feather in the cap to be able to say you can potentially decrease the risk of stroke.""

It's a major limitation that the current analysis is post-hoc, Martha Gulati, MD, University of Arizona, Phoenix emphasized to theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology. But ""If the findings of GALACTIC HF are confirmed in large, prospective randomized controlled trials, this drug would add significantly to the guideline-directed medical therapy recommended for patients with HFrEF.""

Multiple Effects Likely Contribute

The observed stroke benefit associated with fewer cases of new-onset AF/AFl in GALACTIC-HF may also owe to ventricular reverse-remodeling on omecamtiv mecarbil evidenced in the study and in the earlier ATOMIC-AHF and COSMIC-HF trials. There were also suggestions that the drug improves ejection fraction, natriuretic peptide levels, and sympathetic drive.

The ""decrease in atrial fib rate is probably the main mechanism, but heart failure is a prothrombotic state even in the absence of [atrial fibrillation],"" Gulati noted. So the stroke-risk reduction may also derive independently from the observed structural and physiologic changes.

Omecamtiv mecarbil strengthens ventricular contractile force by stabilizing myosin in the pre-power stroke state, which boosts the amount of primed myosin that can bind to actin filaments, a mechanism that sets it apart from conventional positive inotropic agents.

It isn't approved anywhere but is likely undergoing or soon to undergo review by US regulators after more than a decade of promising phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.

GALACTIC-HF entered 8256 patients on standard drug therapy for chronic HFrEF and left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) no higher than 35% who were either hospitalized or hospitalized within the past year or required an emergency department visit for heart failure. About 53% were in NYHA class 2, 44% in class 3, and the remainder in class 4.

The benefit seen across the whole trial was ""substantially better in patients who have some other risk factor,"" Teerlink observed. The trial suggests that you get ""better bang for your buck,"" for example, in patients with ejection fractions less than 30%, in at least NYHA class 3, or with natriuretic peptides considerably elevated beyond entry criteria requirements, he noted.

""We need to have as many therapeutic options as possible, because sometimes patients don't tolerate other therapies,"" observed Greene. In GALACTIC-HF, he noted, there was little effect from omecamtiv mecarbil on blood pressure or an adverse effect on renal function, and the benefits seemed more pronounced in sicker patients.

""So potentially the patients who need the most help — that's where this drug seemed to be safe, well tolerated, and helpful.""

In the current analysis, there were 194 first fatal or nonfatal stroke events, but the hazard ratio (HR) for that endpoint among those on omecamtiv mecarbil was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.49 - 0.87, P = .004). It was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.31 - 0.99, P = .048) for fatal stroke by itself.

The HR for fatal or nonfatal stroke among the trial's 754 patients with a history of stroke was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.09 - 0.56, P = .001) and was nonsignificant for those without a stroke history.

The risk of new-onset AF/AFl dropped on omecamtiv mecarbil such that the HR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.50 - 0.99, P = .044) among patients without such arrhythmia documented at study entry, and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.37 - 1.00, P = .048) for those without any AF/AFl history, Teerlink reported.

Importantly for context, he said, new-onset AF/AFl was documented as a serious adverse event ""so it included only events requiring hospitalization or intervention.""

With the field's current focus on the four pillars of HFrEF medical therapy and how to ensure them for patients, ""we have to keep focusing on the residual risk that heart failure patients face even despite being very well treated,"" Greene said.

""Drugs like omecamtiv mecarbil I think are going to be helpful for patients to reduce that residual risk,"" he added, ""and for patients who can't tolerate some of our other heart failure therapies, given that this drug in particular is especially well tolerated.""

Teerlink discloses consulting fees from Abbott, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Cytokinetics, Medtronic, Merck, Novartis, Servier, Verily, and Windtree Therapeutics; and research contracts with Abbott, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Cytokinetics, Medtronic, Novartis, and Windtree Therapeutics.

42,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963391,health,"Nov. 19, 2021 — President Joe Biden is in ""good spirits"" following his trip to Walter Reed hospital today for his first annual physical exam and routine colonoscopy as commander-in-chief, according to White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki.

A colonoscopy is a medical procedure where doctors examine your large intestine (colon) and your rectum.

A flexible tube with a small camera at the tip is inserted inside your rectum, so that doctors can check for signs of colon cancer, bleeding, or any other abnormalities.

Because Biden went under anesthesia — a treatment that makes you sleepy and prevents you from feeling pain — he temporarily transferred presidential power to Vice President Kamala Harris, making her the first woman in U.S. history to serve as acting president, though only for around 90 minutes.

The 25th amendment to the Constitution allows for this transfer of power when a president is unable to fulfill their duties. These powers are then shifted to the vice president, until the president documents in writing that he can, once again, fully resume his role."

(Reuters) - AstraZeneca on Thursday cemented its lead in bringing a prophylactic COVID-19 shot to market, saying its antibody cocktail offered 83% protection over six months, providing another possible weapon in the fight against the pandemic.

The therapy, called AZD7442 or Evusheld, had previously been shown to confer 77% protection against symptomatic illness after three months, in an earlier readout of the late-stage PROVENT trial https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/astrazeneca-antibody-works-prevent-treat-covid-19-longer-term-studies-2021-11-18 in August.

The Anglo-Swedish company also said a separate study in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 showed a higher dose of AZD7442 cut the risk of symptoms worsening by 88% when given within three days of first symptoms.

The monoclonal antibody treatment, enhanced to remain intact in the body for months, is given in one go, as two sequential shots in the arm.

The latest results from the longer-term follow-ups potentially position AstraZeneca, like rival Pfizer as a future supplier of both COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, with AstraZeneca having said the therapy's ""real advantage"" was as a preventive shot.

The full results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

Pfizer has presented promising efficacy data on its oral COVID-19 treatment candidate, which can be more easily distributed than injections, and is also a leading vaccine supplier with partner BioNTech.

""These new data add to the growing body of evidence supporting AZD7442's potential ... We are progressing regulatory filings around the world and look forward to providing an important new option against SARS-CoV-2 as quickly as possible,"" AstraZeneca Executive Vice President Mene Pangalos said in a statement (https://bit.ly/2Z01G57).

The group last month sought approval for the medicine from U.S. and European authorities. Monoclonal antibodies from Regeneron, Lilly and GSK-Vir have been approved by U.S. regulators for treating unhospitalised COVID-19 patients.

Earlier this month, Regeneron https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/regenerons-antibody-therapy-shows-long-term-protection-against-covid-19-2021-11-08 said a single dose of its antibody cocktail reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 by 81.6% in a late-stage trial.

LONG-TERM

""This is an important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for COVID"" if the published study confirms the data released on Thursday, said Penny Ward, visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King's College London.

While the injection may be seen as a potential alternative to vaccines, antibody drugs cost significantly more, which may limit their use to particularly high-risk groups.

Antibody cocktails typically cost above $1,000 per dose, while COVID-19 shots have on average sold for between $3 and $30 per dose.

Astra's Executive Vice President for vaccines and immune therapies, Iskra Reic, said on a call with media that unlike its vaccine, the drug would be priced commercially as it negotiates supply contracts with governments around the globe.

Chief executive Pascal Soriot said the treatment was more complicated to produce than a vaccine but that there would be enough production capacity around the world to meet demand.

AstraZeneca has said the shot is primarily meant to help immunocompromised and at-risk individuals but at some point a wider group could benefit, such as military personnel on tours of duty or cruise ship passengers.

It would be administered in addition to vaccines, the company has said.

It added that about 2% of the global population was considered to inadequately respond to a COVID-19 vaccine.

For AstraZeneca's PROVENT trial, close to 5,200 participants without an infection were randomly split into two groups, with one volunteer receiving placebo for every two receiving Evusheld.

Participants were at risk of suffering severe COVID-19 if infected or were immunocompromised, meaning they were in cancer care, or receiving drugs due to an autoimmune disease or an organ transplant.

The trial volunteers were not vaccinated, even though high-risk groups have been prioritised in global vaccination campaigns. Anyone opting to get vaccinated during the trial was excluded from the analysis.

Trial volunteers will be followed up for 15 months to provide evidence of longer-lasting protection."
44,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963389,health,"Cases of the flu, that once annual viral intruder that was regularly the country’s worst annual health crisis, is showing signs of waking up again this fall.

But, experts say, it is far too early to say if the country will have a normal – i.e., bad – flu season or a repeat of last year, when the flu all but disappeared amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

This flu season is starting out more like the seasons before the pandemic. About 2% of all visits to doctors and outpatient clinics through Nov. 13 were flu or flu-like illnesses, compared to about 1.4% a year ago, the CDC says. Cases so far are being counted in the hundreds – 702 through Nov. 13.

Still, while cases are low, they are increasing, the agency says. The spread of flu is already high in New Mexico and moderate in Georgia. The rest of the country is seeing little activity, according to the CDC.

This time last year, cases of flu, hospitalizations and deaths were down dramatically, despite fears that a drastic ''twindemic"" could occur if cases of COVID-19 and influenza increased greatly, and in tandem. The comparisons of last year's flu season statistics to previous years are startling — in a good way.

In the 2019-2020 season, more 22,000 people in the U.S. died from flu; last year, deaths decreased to about 700 for the 2020-2021 season.

So, what might happen this year? Will flu be a no-show once again? Several top experts say it’s complicated:

""It's a hot question and I'd love to give you a concrete answer. But everyone is having trouble predicting."" -- Stuart Ray, MD, professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore.

""It's very hard to predict exactly where the flu season will land. What seems to be the case is that it will be worse than last year, but it's unclear whether or not it will be an ordinary flu season."" -- Amesh Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

""There will be flu, but I can't tell you how bad it will be."" We do know that flu will be back."" -- William Schaffner, MD, infectious disease specialist and professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.

Already, Schaffner says, “we are beginning to hear about some outbreaks.""

One outbreak triggering concern is at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where 528 flu cases have been diagnosed at the University Health Service since Oct. 6. The CDC sent a team to investigate the outbreak. Florida A&M University and Florida State University have also seen large outbreaks this month.

Outbreaks on college campuses are not surprising, Schaffner said. ""That’s a population that is under-vaccinated,"" he says, and students are often in close quarters with many others. University of Michigan officials said 77% of the cases are in unvaccinated people.

Predictions about this year's flu season also have to take into account that mask wearing and social distancing that were common last year, but have become less common or sometimes nonexistent this year.

Despite uncertainty about how this year's flu season will play out, several changes and advances in play for this year's flu season are aimed at keeping illness low.

The composition of the vaccines has been updated — and each vaccine targets four viruses expected to circulate.

The flu vaccine and the COVID vaccines can be given at the same time.

The CDC has updated guidance for timing of the flu vaccine for some people.

A new dashboard is tracking flu vaccination rates nationwide, and the CDC has an education campaign, fearing the importance of the flu vaccine has taken a back seat with the attention largely on COVID and its vaccine since the pandemic began.

What's in This Year's Vaccine?

This year, all the flu vaccines in the U.S. are four component (quadrivalent) shots, meant to protect against the four flu viruses most likely to spread and cause sickness this season.

The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Product Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) selects the specific viruses that each year's vaccine should target. To select, they take into account surveillance data with details about recent influenza cultures, responses to the previous year's vaccines and other information.

Both the egg-based vaccines and the cell- or recombinant-based vaccines will target two influenza A strains and two influenza B strains. Options include injections or a nasal spray.

Several of the formulas are approved for use in those age 65 and up, including a high-dose vaccine and the adjuvanted flu vaccine. The aim of each is to create a stronger immune response, as people's immune systems weaken with age. However, the CDC cautions people not to put off the vaccination while waiting for the high-dose or adjuvanted. Getting the vaccine that's available is the best thing to do, experts say.

Vaccine Timing

In general, September and October were good times for flu vaccinations, the CDC says. While it's ideal to be vaccinated by the end of October, it still recommends vaccinating later than that rather than skipping it.

Even if you are unvaccinated in December or January, it's still a good idea to get it then, Schaffner agrees. You would still get some protection, he says, since ''for the most part in the U.S., flu peaks in February."" But he stresses that earlier is better.

While children can get vaccinated as soon as doses are available — even July or August — adults, especially if 65 and older, because of their weakened immune systems, should generally not get vaccinated that early. That's because protection will decrease over time and they may not be protected for the entire flu season. But, early is better than not at all, the CDC says.

Some children ages 6 months to 8 years may need two doses of flu vaccine. Those getting vaccinated for the first time need two doses (spaced 4 weeks apart). Others in this age group who only got one dose previously need to get 2 doses this season.

Early vaccination can also be considered for women in the third trimester of pregnancy, because the immunization can help provide protection to their infants after birth. Infants can't be vaccinated until age 6 months.

Two Arms, Two Vaccines

With millions of Americans now lining up for their COVID-19 boosters, experts urge them to get the flu vaccine at the same time. It's acceptable to get both vaccines the same day, experts agree.

""You can [even] do 2 in one arm, spaced by an inch,"" says L.J. Tan, PhD, chief policy and partnership officer, Immunization Action Coalition, an organization devoted to increasing immunization rates. ""We co-administer vaccines to kids all the time.""

And, Tan says, ''the flu vaccine is not going to amplify any reaction you would have to the COVID vaccine.""

Tracking Vaccinations

According to the CDC National Flu Vaccination Dashboard, about 162 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed as of Nov. 5.

It expects about 58.5% of the population to get a flu shot this season, up from about 54.8% last season.

Undoing the ""Flu Isn't Bad"" Thinking

One common misconception, especially from parents, is that ''the flu is not bad, it doesn't cause serious problems,"" says Flor M. Munoz, MD, MSc, medical director of transplant infectious diseases at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston.

""Flu by itself can be serious,"" she says. And now, with COVID, she says, ''we do worry. If someone got both infections, they could get quite sick.""

Among the potential complications in kids, especially those under 5 years, are pneumonia, dehydration, brain dysfunction and sinus and ear infections.

The vaccine for flu, like for COVID, isn't perfect, she also tells parents. ""In a good year, it gives 60 to 70% protection. "" But it can be much less protective than that, too. Even so, ""if you get vaccinated and still get the flu, you will have milder illness.""

Anti-Virals to the Rescue

When flu symptoms — fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headaches, chills and fatigue — appear, anti-viral treatments can lessen the time you are sick by about a day, according to the CDC. They are available only by prescription and work best when started within 2 days of becoming sick with flu.

Four antiviral drugs to treat flu are FDA-approved, including:

Depending on the drug and method of administration, the drugs are given for 1 to 5 days, generally, but sometimes longer than 5 days.

Track Local Flu Rates

Ray of Johns Hopkins suggests keeping an eye on how widespread flu is in your community, just as we've gotten used to tracking COVID rates, and then taking precautions such as masking up and social distancing. ""Maybe we are a little more nimble now in responding to risk,"" he says, given the practice gotten with COVID.

He says adapting these habits in responding to flu outbreaks would be helpful—and more natural for most people than in the past. ''I don’t think it was usual ever, 3 years ago, to see people out in masks when flu rates were high.""

45,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963382,health,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Frozen vials labeled ""Smallpox"" that were discovered in a freezer at a vaccine research facility in Pennsylvania ""contain no trace of virus known to cause smallpox,"" federal health officials said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that testing showed the vials contain ""vaccinia, the virus used in smallpox vaccine"" and not the variola virus, which causes smallpox.

The CDC had said Monday that the vials ""were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker"" who was wearing gloves and a face mask while cleaning out the freezer. The CDC said no one was exposed to the contents.

Mark O'Neill, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, told the New York Times that the vials were found at a Merck facility in Montgomery County.

It was not clear why the vials were in the freezer. The CDC said it was ""in close contact with state and local health officials, law enforcement, and the World Health Organization"" about the findings.

Smallpox is a deadly, infectious disease that plagued the world for centuries and killed nearly a third of the people it infected. Victims suffered scorching fever and body aches, and then spots and blisters that would leave survivors with pitted scars.

The United States ended routine childhood vaccination against the disease by the early 1970s and said the last natural outbreak in the country occurred in 1949. In 1980, the World Health Assembly declared smallpox eradicated.

There are two sites designated by the WHO where stocks of variola virus are stored and used for research: the CDC facility in Atlanta and a center in Russia.

Smallpox research in the United States focuses on the development of vaccines, drugs and diagnostic tests to protect people against smallpox in the event that it is used as an agent of bioterrorism, according to the CDC."
46,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963378,health,"While often linked to deleterious outcomes in certain disease states, the hepatocyte-produced inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) may be a checkpoint that protects against acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury, according to research findings.

Based on the study findings, researchers believe long-term suppression of CRP function or expression may increase an individual's susceptibility to acetaminophen-induced liver injury. In contrast, CRP ""could be exploited as a promising therapeutic approach to treat hepatotoxicity caused by drug overdose"" wrote study authors Hai-Yun Li, MD, of the Xi'an Jiaotong University in Shaanxi, China, and colleagues in Cellular and Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

According to Li and colleagues, a major cause of acute liver failure is acetaminophen-induced liver injury, but despite this risk, very few treatment options for this condition exist. The only approved treatment for this complication is N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).

Although CRP represents a marker for inflammation following tissue injury, a study from 2020 and one from 2018 suggest the protein regulates complement activation and may modulate responses of immune cells. The authors of the current study noted that few studies have explored what roles complement activation and modulated immune cell responses via CRP play in acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury.

To further elucidate the role of CRP in this setting, Li and researchers assessed the mechanisms of CRP action both in vitro as well as in CRP mice with Fcy receptor 2B knockout. The researchers suggested CRP may modulate immune cell responses via these receptors. Additionally, the investigators assessed CRP action in mice with C3 knockout, given previous studies suggesting C3 knockout may alleviate acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice.

The researchers also investigated hepatic expression of CRP mutants that were defective in complement interaction. Finally, the researchers sought to understand the therapeutic potential of the inflammatory marker by performing intraperitoneal administration of human CRP at 2 or 6 hours after induction of acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury in wild-type mice.

Injection of 300 mg/kg acetaminophen over 24 hours led to overt liver injury in wild-type mice, which was characterized by increased levels of circulating alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) as well as massive necrosis of hepatocytes. The researchers noted that these manifestations were exacerbated significantly in the CRP knockout mice.

The intravenous administration of human CRP in the mice with the drug-induced liver injury rescued defects caused by mouse CRP knockout. Additionally, human CRP administration alleviated acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury in the wild-type mice. The researchers wrote that these findings demonstrate that endogenous and human CRP ""are both protective,"" at least in mouse models of acetaminophen-induced liver injury.

In a second experiment, the researchers examined the mechanisms involved in CRP protection in early phases of drug-induced liver injury. Based on the experiment, the researchers found that the knockout of an inhibitory Fcy receptor mediating the anti-inflammatory activities of CRP demonstrated only ""marginal effects"" on the protection of the protein in acetaminophen-induced liver injury.

Overall, the investigators suggested that the inflammatory marker does not likely act via the cellular Fcy receptor 2B to inhibit early phases of acetaminophen-induced hepatocyte injury. Rather, the investigators explained that CRP may act via factor H, which is recruited by CRP in regulating complement activation, to inhibit overactivation of complement on injured hepatocytes. Ultimately, the researchers explained, this results in suppression of the late phase amplification of inflammation that is mediated by neutrophils' C3a-dependent actions.

Finally, the researchers found that intraperitoneal administration of human CRP at 2.5 mg/kg in wild-type mice at 2 hours following induction of acetaminophen-induced liver injury led to ""markedly reduced liver injury,"" with an efficacy that was similar to that of 500 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine, the only available treatment approved for acetaminophen-induced liver injury.

The researchers noted that N-acetylcysteine is only effective during the early phases of the acetaminophen-induced liver injury and loses effectiveness at 6 hours following injury. In contrast, human CRP in this study was still highly effective at this time point. ""Given that people can tolerate high levels of circulating CRP, the administration of this protein might be a promising option to treat [acetaminophen-induced liver injury] with minimal side effects,"" the researchers wrote.

The study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China. The researchers reported no conflicts of interest with any pharmaceutical companies.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, signed off on a recommendation Friday evening to let all US adults get a COVID-19 booster shot.

The endorsement, following a unanimous vote by a panel of CDC advisors earlier in the day backing a third dose of a Moderna or Pfizer mRNA COVID vaccine, now means everyone over the age of 18 is eligible for a booster.

“After critical scientific evaluation, today’s unanimous decision carefully considered the current state of the pandemic, the latest vaccine effectiveness data over time, and review of safety data from people who have already received a COVID-19 primary vaccine series and booster.

""Booster shots have demonstrated the ability to safely increase people’s protection against infection and severe outcomes and are an important public health tool to strengthen our defenses against the virus as we enter the winter holidays. Based on the compelling evidence, all adults over 18 should now have equitable access to a COVID-19 booster dose,” Walensky said in a prepared statement.

Earlier Friday the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized boosters for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for all adults, setting the stage for the CDC's decision.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, recommended that the additional dose be given at least 6 months after the second dose.

They also strengthened a recommendation that everyone over the age of 50 should get a third dose of, whether or not they have an underlying health condition that may increase their risk from a COVID-19 infection.

The committee voted 11 to 0 to in favor of both policies.

Reassuring Safety Information

The panel based its decision on the results of a new study of boosters in Pfizer vaccine recipients, as well as reassuring safety information that’s being collected through the CDC and the FDA's monitoring systems.

Pfizer presented the early results from a study of 10,000 people who had all received two doses of its vaccine. Half of the study participants received a third shot, or booster. The other half got a placebo.

The study is ongoing, but so far, six of the people in the booster group have gotten a COVID-19 infection with symptoms compared to 123 people who got COVID-19 in the placebo group, making boosters 95% effective at keeping people from getting sick.

Most people in the study had gotten their original doses about 10 months earlier. They’ve been followed for about 10 weeks since their booster.

Importantly, there were no study participants hospitalized for COVID-19 infections in either the placebo or booster group, indicating that the first two doses were still very effective at preventing severe outcomes from infection.

In the Pfizer study, the benefits of boosters were seen as fast as 7 days after study participants got their shots.

The majority of side effects after a third Pfizer dose were mild and temporary. Side effects like sore arms, swelling, fever, headache, and fatigue were more common in the booster group — affecting about 1 in 4 people who got a third shot.

Vaccination side effects were less common after boosters than have been seen after the second dose of the vaccine, with one exception: swollen lymph nodes, which were more common after boosters, but were temporary.

Some cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported after people received vaccine boosters, but the risk for this heart inflammation appears to be extremely low, about two cases for every million doses given.

There were 54 cases of myocarditis reported so far to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. To date, only 12 have met the case definition and are considered related to vaccination. Most of the reported cases are still being studied.

The risk of myocarditis after a booster dose may be less likely than it is after receipt of second vaccine doses, but it’s still too early to be sure said the CDC’s Tom Shimabukuro, MD, MPH, who leads the vaccine safety study team.

There was less data on how well third shots are working for Moderna vaccine recipients. The company presented very little new data on its half-dose boosters. But based on blood tests, it seems that their boosters also substantially increase antibody levels.

In addition to preventing symptomatic infections, there’s new evidence that booster doses may stop transmission of the virus, at least for a couple of months.

Sara Oliver, MD, who is an officer with the the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service, highlighted two recent studies showing that boosters provide protection against asymptomatic infections, which could help curtail the spread of the virus.

Boosters may help stop even asymptomatic infections because they boost a person’s antibodies to a level that provides so-called sterilizing immunity.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) supported Friday's decisions, imploring all eligible Americans to take action.

""As cases are rising in some parts of the United States, infectious diseases experts urge everyone who is eligible — including children 5 and older — to get vaccinated. Before you travel or gather with loved ones this holiday season, get vaccinated so you can celebrate safely,"" IDSA President Daniel P. McQuillen, MD, said in a prepared statement.

LANSING, Michigan (AP) — Faced with spiking COVID-19 infections, Michigan health officials said Friday that they will issue a public health advisory recommending that everyone over age 2 years wear a mask at indoor gatherings regardless of their vaccination status.

They also said businesses should implement policies ensuring that customers and employees are masked. They stopped short of requiring face coverings.

The officials pleaded with people to get the coronavirus vaccine, a flu shot and, if eligible, a coronavirus booster dose as the state finds itself dealing with a fourth surge in cases since the pandemic started. The step came before the holiday season, when families in the state with the country's highest 7-day case rate will gather indoors to celebrate.

Roughly 73% of Michigan infections, 72% of hospitalizations, and 76% of deaths were among the unvaccinated or those partially vaccinated over the most recent 30-day period for which there is complete data, said Dr Natasha Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive.

""Today, we are at another crucial point. We have a chance to turn the tide and these rising numbers. We have done it before. But whether or not we do will depend on everyone in Michigan,"" said Elizabeth Hertel, the director of the state Department of Health and Human Services.

The agency will recommend face coverings but not require them, keeping with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's shift away from such mandates earlier this year.

Metrics presented on a call with reporters are ""quite troubling,"" Bagdasarian said.

The positivity rate was above 15% in all regions and higher than 20% in three — Grand Rapids, Saginaw, and Jackson. The case rate was trending similarly to the state's curve in the fall of 2020. COVID-19 hospitalizations, meanwhile, were at 77% of their peak last spring.

The health department, citing guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, issued specific recommendations for holiday gatherings. People gathering with multiple households from different areas of the state or country should consider precautions such as getting tested for COVID-19. Universal masking is urged in households where someone is unvaccinated, at increased risk of the virus, or has a weakened immune system.

49,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963376,health,"LAS VEGAS – Although endoscopic resection of T1 esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is associated with excellent overall survival, recurrence can occur years later, emphasizing the need for long-term surveillance, according to investigators.

Recurrence was about twice as common among patients lacking complete remission of intestinal metaplasia (CRIM) upon follow-up, reported lead author Kevin Song, MD, of the Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Ariz., and colleagues.

""Endoscopic resection of early-stage EAC has gained acceptance in recent years,"" Song said during his presentation at the annual meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology. ""While studies have demonstrated promising outcomes for short-term remission and recurrence, little is known about long-term recurrence and EAC-related mortality beyond 5 years.""

To address this knowledge gap, Song and colleagues reviewed data from 98 patients who had undergone endoscopic resection of T1 EAC at four tertiary academic centers with follow-up of at least 5 years. CRIM was defined by negative biopsies from the tubular esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction at one posttreatment surveillance endoscopy. Early recurrence was defined by a 2-year limit.

After a median follow-up of 8.76 years, 93 out of 98 patients (95%) experienced remission, while 82 patients (84%) demonstrated CRIM. Fourteen patients (14%) had recurrence of EAC, among whom eight (57%) had early recurrence at a median of 0.75 years (interquartile range, 0.43-0.80 years), while the other six (43%) had late recurrence at a median of 7.7 years (IQR, 5.20-8.77 years). Among the 93 patients entering remission, five (5.38%) had recurrence after 5 years.

CRIM was associated with a significantly lower rate of recurrence (11% vs. 46%; P = .01), generating an odds ratio of 6.55 (95% confidence interval, 1.71-26.71). Patients with CRIM also had later recurrence, at a median of 5.20 years, compared with 0.81 years for patients without CRIM. Moreover, the overall EAC-related mortality rate was 6.45%.

Song noted excellent overall survival and concluded his presentation by emphasizing the predictive value of CRIM and the need for long-term surveillance.

""CRIM should be considered the most significant endpoint for endotherapy of T1 EAC,"" he said. ""Surveillance is important even when early recurrence is not observed.""

Rishindra M. Reddy, MD, professor of thoracic surgery at the University of Michigan Health, Ann Arbor, agreed ""100%"" with Song and colleagues' conclusion about the need for long-term surveillance.

""We struggle, in our patient population, to get people to do regular surveillance,"" he said. ""I think you have to have patients who have regular access to their gastroenterologist or surgeons and are willing to come in every 3 months to 6 months for surveillance endoscopies as well as CT scans.""

Reddy recommended that endoscopic resection of EAC be handled at high-volume centers.

""This really needs to be done in a multidisciplinary setting where you have both experienced endoscopists and thoracic surgeons and/or surgical oncologists who do esophagectomies to make these decisions about optimal treatment,"" he said, ""as well as pathologists who are more experienced in what to look for in terms of depth or lateral margins.""

The present work is a ""great first study,"" Reddy said. He suggested that larger real-world trials are needed to confirm findings and compare outcomes between tumor subtypes.

""I think for T1a tumors, there's a good consensus on endoscopic mucosal resection,"" he said. ""I think T1b is an area where we would suggest more often doing surgery… and there's even some nuance at a T1a level about the depth. It would be helpful to understand the risks of recurrence after [resecting] different levels of T1 tumors.""

The investigators disclosed relationships with CDX, Interpace, Lucid, and others. Reddy disclosed no relevant conflicts of interest.

A vendor at an animal market in Wuhan, China, was probably the first person to contract COVID-19, continuing an international debate about when the coronavirus pandemic originated, according to an American scientist.

Michael Worobey of the University of Arizona wrote ""Dissecting the early COVID-19 cases in Wuhan"" in the online journal Science after studying public records, news reports, and medical journal entries about the outbreak in Wuhan.

Previously, the first person thought to have contracted COVID-19 was a male accountant in Wuhan who lived miles from the market, did not visit the market, and reported COVID symptoms around Dec. 16, 2019, The New York Times reported.

Confusion about when his symptoms first appeared was caused by the accountant's report of a dental problem on Dec. 8 that apparently was unrelated to COVID, according to the Times.

""This is corroborated by hospital records and a scientific paper that reports his COVID-19 onset date as 16 December and date of hospitalization as 22 December,"" the study said. ""This indicates that he was infected through community transmission after the virus had begun spreading from Huanan Market.""

Worobey wrote that multiple workers at the market had gotten sick with COVID-like symptoms before that, ""making a female seafood vendor there the earliest known case, with illness onset 11 December,"" he wrote. ""Notably, she reported knowledge of several possible COVID-19 cases in clinics and hospitals that were near Huanan Market from 11 December, and Huanan Market patients were hospitalized at Union Hospital as early as 10 December.""

""In this city of 11 million people, half of the early cases are linked to a place that's the size of a soccer field. It becomes very difficult to explain that pattern if the outbreak didn't start at the market,"" Worobey said when commenting on the study to the Times.

The World Health Organization earlier this year said that the virus probably jumped from animals to humans who worked in the wildlife trade. The WHO discounted the idea that the virus somehow leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan.

51,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963368,health,"The Food and Drug Administration on November 12 approved ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft (Besremi), a monopegylated, long-acting interferon, for adults with polycythemia vera, according to an agency press release.

Besremi has a longer half-life than do other pegylated interferon-alfas, allowing for dosing every 2 weeks instead of weekly. If red blood cell counts remain normal for a year, patients have the option of switching to once-monthly dosing. As with similar products, Besremi is self-administered as a subcutaneous injection.

It's the first interferon approved in the United States specifically for polycythemia vera. Besremi is also approved for upfront therapy, unlike FDA's first approval for the condition, the oral JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib (Jakafi), which is indicated only after hydroxyurea failure.

Taiwan-based maker PharmaEssentia said in another press release that it will roll Besremi out to the US market in the coming weeks.

""As we begin working closely with the community to integrate this important treatment into clinical practice, we also continue to expand our scientific efforts to unlock the full potential of our pioneering molecule,"" said Ko-Chung Lin, PhD, the company's CEO.

As for unlocking the full potential, Besremi is under investigation for other interferon indications, including myelofibrosis, leukemia, and chronic hepatitis.

The FDA's approval was based on results in 51 adults treated for an average of 5 years; 31 (61%) had a complete hematologic response, defined as a hematocrit below 45% with no phlebotomy for at least 2 months, plus normal platelet and white cell counts, normal spleen size, and no blood clots.

""Noninferiority to hydroxyurea regarding haematological response and normal spleen size was not shown at 12 months. However, response to ropeginterferon alfa-2b continued to increase over time with improved responses compared with hydroxyurea at 36 months,"" investigators noted in an earlier report (Lancet Haematol. 2020r;7[3]:e196-e208).

Besremi carries the same boxed warning as those of peginterferon alfa-2b (Pegintron) and peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys), which notes the risk of life-threatening neuropsychiatric, autoimmune, ischemic, and infectious disorders. Related contraindications include severe depression and other psychiatric problems; liver impairment; serious or untreated autoimmune disease, and immunosuppression following organ transplant.

Influenza-like illness, arthralgia, fatigue, pruritis, nasopharyngitis, and musculoskeletal pain were the most common adverse events in studies, occurring in over 40% of subjects. Urinary tract infections, transient ischemic attacks, and depression were the most frequent serious complications, occurring in over 4%.

Labeling also notes the risk for fetal harm and the need for effective contraception.

Besremi was approved in Europe in 2019 and is approved in Taiwan and South Korea.

Polycythemia vera is a rare condition thought to be caused by acquired bone marrow stem cell mutations that trigger an overproduction of red blood cells. Patients are at increased risk of blood clots and emboli, and subsequent heart attacks, strokes, and other problems. There's also the risk of transformation to secondary myelofibrosis or leukemia.

52,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963370,health,"Mothers who use cannabis during pregnancy risk disrupting immune gene networks in the placenta and potentially increasing the risk of anxiety and hyperactivity in their children.

These findings emerged from a study led by Yasmin Hurd, PhD, a professor of psychiatry and director of the Addiction Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, and Yoko Nomura, PhD, a professor of behavioral neuroscience at Queen's College, City University of New York, that was published online in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The analysis assessed the effects of gestational maternal cannabis use on psychosocial and physiological measures in young children as well as its potentially immunomodulatory effect on the in utero environment as reflected in the placental transcriptome.

Participants were drawn from a larger cohort in a study launched in 2012; the investigators evaluated offspring aged 3-6 years for hair hormone levels, neurobehavioral traits on the Behavioral Assessment System for Children survey, and heart rate variability (HRV) at rest and during auditory startle.

The cohort consisted of 322 mother-child dyads and children with prenatal exposure to cannabis were compared with those having no exposure. The cohort consisted of 251 non–cannabis-using mothers and 71 cannabis-using mothers, with mean maternal ages in the two groups of 28.46 years and 25.91 years, respectively, The mothers gave birth at Mount Sinai and they and their children were assessed annually at affiliated medical centers in Mount Sinai's catchment area.

For a subset of children with behavioral assessments, placental specimens collected at birth were processed for RNA sequencing.

Among the findings:

Maternal cannabis use was associated with reduced maternal and paternal age, more single-mother pregnancies, state anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, cigarette smoking, and African American race.

Hair hormone analysis revealed increased cortisol levels in the children of cannabis-using mothers, and was associated with greater anxiety, aggression, and hyperactivity.

Affected children showed a reduction in the high-frequency component of HRV at baseline, reflecting reduced vagal tone.

In the placenta, there was reduced expression of many genes involved in immune system function. These included genes for type I interferon, neutrophil, and cytokine-signaling pathways.

Several of these genes organized into coexpression networks that correlated with child anxiety and hyperactivity.

The principal active component of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), targets the endocannabinoid system in placental tissue and the developing brain, the authors noted. Exposure during pregnancy is associated with a range of adverse outcomes from fetal growth restriction to low birth weight and preterm birth.

""There are cannabinoid receptors on immune cells, and it is known that cannabinoids can alter immune function, which is important for maintaining maternal tolerance and protecting the fetus,"" Hurd said. ""It's not surprising that something that affects the immune cells can have an impact on the developing fetus.""

""Overall, our findings reveal a relationship between [maternal cannabis use] and immune response gene networks in the placenta as a potential mediator of risk for anxiety-related problems in early childhood,"" Hurd and colleagues wrote, adding that the results have significant implications for defining mental health issues in the children gestated by cannabis-smoking mothers.

Their results align with previous research indicating a greater risk for psychiatric illness in children with prenatal cannabis exposure from maternal use.

""While data are pretty limited in this realm, there are other studies that demonstrate a relationship between early child developmental and behavioral measures and cannabis use during pregnancy,"" Camille Hoffman, MD, MSc, a high-risk obstetrics specialist and an associate professor at the University of Colorado at Denver, Aurora, said in an interview. ""Our research group found children exposed to cannabis in utero at 10 weeks' gestation and beyond were less interactive and more withdrawn than children who were not exposed.""

And THC remains in maternal breast milk even 6 weeks after usage stops.

The long-term effects of prenatal cannabis exposure remain to be determined and it is unknown whether the effects of gestational THC might attenuate as a child grows older. ""We use early childhood measures in research as a proxy for the later development of diagnosed mental health conditions or behavioral problems,"" Hoffman explained. ""We know when we do this that not every child with an abnormal score early will go on to develop an actual condition. Fortunately, or unfortunately, other factors and exposures during childhood can change the trajectory for the better or worse.""

According to Hurd, child development is a dynamic process and epigenetic events in utero need not be deterministic. ""The important thing is to identify children at risk early and to be able to go in and try to improve the environment they're being raised in – not in terms of impoverishment but in terms of positive nurturing and giving the mother and family support.""

At the prenatal level, what's the best advice for cannabis-using mothers-to-be? ""If a woman doesn't know she's pregnant and has been using cannabis, taking extra choline for the remainder of the pregnancy can help buffer the potential negative impact of the cannabis exposure,"" Hoffman said. The Food and Drug Administration and the American Medical Association recommend a dose of 550 mg daily. ""The same is true for alcohol, which we know is also very bad for fetal brain development. This is not to say go ahead and use these substances and just take choline. The choline is more to try and salvage damage to the fetal brain that may have already occurred.""

This study was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The authors declared no competing interests. Hoffman disclosed no conflicts of interest with respect to her comments.

53,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963369,health,"A group of state attorneys general are investigating the photo-sharing platform Instagram and its effects on children and young adults, saying its parent company Facebook — now called Meta Platforms — ignored internal research about the physical and mental health dangers it posed to young people.

The investigation is led by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general from California, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, Tennessee, and Vermont. It follows damning newspaper reports, first by The Wall Street Journal, based on the company's own research that found that the company knew about the harms Instagram can cause teenagers — especially teen girls — when it comes to mental health and body image issues.

Since those first reports, a consortium of news organizations, including The Associated Press, have published their own findings based on leaked documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, who has testified before Congress and a British parliamentary committee about what she found.

""For too long, Meta has ignored the havoc that Instagram is wreaking on the mental health and well-being of our children and teens,"" said California Attorney General Rob Bonta. ""Enough is enough. We've undertaken this nationwide investigation to get answers about Meta's efforts to promote the use of this social media platform to young Californians – and to determine if, in doing so, Meta violated the law.""

The investigation targets, among other things, the techniques Meta uses to keep young people on its platforms — and the harms that extended time spent on Instagram can cause.

In a statement, Meta spokesperson Liza Crenshaw called the accusations ""false"" and said they demonstrate ""a deep misunderstanding of the facts.""

""While challenges in protecting young people online impact the entire industry, we've led the industry in combating bullying and supporting people struggling with suicidal thoughts, self-injury, and eating disorders,"" Crenshaw said in the statement.

The state investigations follow a Monday announcement that Ohio's largest public employee pension fund had sued Meta, alleging that it broke federal securities law by purposely misleading the public about the negative effects of its social platforms and the algorithms that run them.

The lawsuit by the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System claims that Facebook buried inconvenient findings about how the company has managed those algorithms as well as the steps it said it was taking to protect the public."
54,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963214,health,"SYDNEY/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A Chinese professor at the University of Copenhagen conducted genetic research with the Chinese military without disclosing the connection, the university told Reuters, in the latest example of how China's pursuit of military-civilian technology is tapping into Western academia in the strategically sensitive area of biotechnology.

The professor, Guojie Zhang, is also employed by Shenzhen-based genomics giant BGI Group, which funds dozens of researchers at the university and has its European headquarters on the university's campus.

Zhang and a student he was supervising worked with a People's Liberation Army (PLA) laboratory on research exposing monkeys to extreme altitude to study their brains and develop new drugs to prevent brain damage – a priority the PLA has identified for Chinese troops operating on high plateau borders.

Zhang co-published that paper with a PLA major general in January 2020. At the time the study was published, the university was ""not familiar with the fact that the paper also included authors from Chinese military research institutions,"" Niels Kroer, head of its biology department, told Reuters in an email.

Zhang confirmed that he did not inform the university of the link because the university didn't require researchers to report co-authors on scientific papers to it, which the university confirmed. BGI said the study with the PLA lab ""was not carried out for military purposes"" and brain research is a critical area for understanding human diseases. China's government science academy said the study had national defence and civilian benefits on the Tibetan plateau.

Concerns about China's fusion of military and civilian technology, and about universities transferring sensitive technology to China that could help its military, have grown in the United States in recent years. Washington agreed last month to work with the European Union on the issue under a new joint technology and trade council. A U.S. Department of Defense report on China's military power this month flagged concern over Beijing using biotechnology to enhance its soldiers' performance.

The Danish incident, reported here for the first time, shows how China's pursuit of biotechnology with a military use has also become an issue for universities in Europe.

The European Commission says it is developing guidelines on ""tackling foreign interference"" at higher education institutions; a 2020 report from the Leiden Asia Centre, an independent group affiliated with Leiden University in the Netherlands, found at least five countries in Europe had concerns about the risks of research collaboration with China. Some universities, including Copenhagen, have long had close science ties to China.

Copenhagen university and two large Danish foundations who funded some of Zhang's work said they discovered China's military was involved only after one of the foundations saw it had been credited, incorrectly, with financing the monkey study. The work was funded by the Chinese government and military, the paper said.

The discovery came as Denmark's intelligence agency, PET, warned Danish universities in May of the national security risks of being unwittingly involved in foreign military research, citing ""a number of espionage activities and other foreign interference,"" and a student who co-authored research into 5G technology with an engineer from a Chinese military university. It declined to comment on specific cases.

The Chinese Academy of Science, where Zhang also has a genetics lab, said of the study at the time that brain damage and death caused by high altitude on the Tibetan plateau had severely hindered ""national defence construction.""

Denmark's Ministry of Higher Education and Science declined to comment on the altitude study, but said export control rules apply to some technology that can be used for both civilian and military purposes. The Danish Business Authority said most types of gene technology are not on its export control list.

The ministry said it had launched a broad review of the risks of international research cooperation, led by top university heads, to conclude at the start of next year.

The University of Copenhagen expects the review of ""ethical and security policy limits"" for collaboration will result in new rules for universities - and greater focus on the risks, its deputy director for research and innovation Kim Brinckmann told Reuters in an email.

""We are very proud to have Prof. Zhang ... as one of our very highly performing researchers,"" he said. The university did not respond to a question about how much funding BGI provides it.

China's foreign ministry said it urged Danish institutions to ""abandon ideological prejudice and end groundless accusations and smears,"" and treat their research cooperation rationally ""to accrue positive energy in the development of bilateral relations and practical cooperation.""

ALTITUDE

Zhang and the head of the PLA laboratory for high-altitude research, Major General Yuqi Gao, designed the study, which also lists BGI founders Wang Jian and Yang Huanming as co-authors. BGI's other joint research with Gao has involved soldiers in Tibet and Xinjiang, Reuters reported in January.

That report was cited by two U.S. senators who called in September for BGI to be sanctioned by the United States as a military-linked company. Gao's research has directly improved the ability of China's rapid-advance plateau troops to carry out training and combat missions, according to the Chinese military's official news service.

China's Academy of Military Medical Sciences launched a four-year plan in 2012 for troops to acclimatise and adapt to the low-oxygen Tibetan plateau. That plan said BGI was working with Gao's lab to test soldiers arriving in Tibet and identify genes linked to altitude sickness, which does not affect Tibetans. It said preventing altitude sickness helped to ""manage border areas where ethnic minorities gather,"" and had far-reaching economic and political significance.

BGI told Reuters the research with the military university aimed to understand the health risk for all people travelling to and working at high altitude.

""The project using BGI's technology studied the changes of the pathophysiology and genomics of the human body at very high altitudes,"" a BGI spokesman said. ""In China, many military institutions ... carry out both civilian and military research,"" he added.

Gao wrote in 2018 that high altitude disease ""is the main reason for reduced combat effectiveness and health damage of soldiers at high altitudes and influences the results of war on the highland plateau,"" and noted that drugs could be used in an emergency for the rapid deployment of soldiers.

China's military has recently increased live fire drills in Tibet after border clashes with India.

DEEP TIES

The University of Copenhagen has one of Europe's oldest genetics institutes, and it is BGI's biggest international research partner by count of science papers.

The ties run deep. Two former BGI chief executives, BGI's chairman, and the founder of its animal cloning programme previously studied or worked at Copenhagen. The university hosts more than two dozen BGI-funded researchers undertaking science and health doctorates.

Biology head Kroer told Reuters the university had been unaware of ""claims that BGI has connections with the PLA."" The university said that other than Zhang's salary as a professor, no Danish money was spent on the study, which animal rights activists have argued subjected the animals to suffering and distress.

The student Zhang worked with was in China and employed by BGI, the university said. Zhang's research team was not involved in the animal experiments performed in China, but did analyse the genomic data generated from the experiments, it added.

The Lundbeck Foundation, which primarily funds brain research and was incorrectly listed as a funder of the monkey brain study, ""has not supported this area of his research, nor do we have any knowledge about it,"" a spokesman said of the monkey brain project. Lundbeck said Zhang had told them he was studying ants and genetics and how this could explain brain processes in humans.

The foundation said it asked Zhang this year to remove its name from the study. The Carlsberg Foundation, which controls the world's third-largest brewer and said it gave Zhang a DKK 4 million ($623,000) fellowship in 2016, also told Reuters it had been incorrectly listed as funding the project.

The paper was published in a Chinese journal, Zoological Research, which declined to comment.

Zhang is on the journal's editorial board. He told Reuters the two Danish foundations were mentioned in the paper by mistake. ""We did not spend any funding from the grants I received from these two foundations on this project,"" he added in an email. The journal published a correction removing the foundations' names in March 2021.

Lundbeck declined to comment on what impact the discovery might have; Carlsberg has said animal experiments conducted overseas must comply with Danish regulations, but did not comment on the military involvement.

INTERNAL DEBATE

In June 2020, the University of Copenhagen decided to close a think tank it had run with Shanghai's Fudan University since 2013, saying it had adjusted its overall cooperation strategy.

The decision prompted a debate about China inside the university, documents obtained by Reuters under freedom of information rules show. The university held a meeting in August 2020 to discuss the closure of Fudan and review its collaboration with China.

""China has engaged in a strategic civil-military fusion of research that often blurs the lines to the outsider,"" China Studies professor Jorgen Delman said in a note to the university's head afterwards, recommending better screening of Chinese researchers and consultations with Danish military intelligence to advise on ""risks and no-go areas."" He declined to comment further.

Genetic cloning technology was transferred to BGI after a researcher, Yutao Du, received her doctorate in 2007 with a team from Danish universities that created the world's first pigs using a technique called handmade cloning. She was praised by the Chinese government for bringing the technology to China, which went on to clone genetically modified pigs for the study of human neurological illnesses.

China's national science programme said cloned pigs were a stepping stone to chimeras, a controversial area where China wanted to lead the world. Chimeras are organisms composed of cells from two or more species that may be capable of growing organs for human transplantation.

Du is now vice president at BGI Genomics Ltd, and won promotion within the Chinese Communist Party, becoming a delegate to its national congress in 2017. She did not respond to a request for comment."

PARKER, Colo. — The Marker family opened their door on a recent evening to a woman dressed in purple, with a military attitude to cleanliness.

Linda Holmes, who has worked as a technician with LiceDoctors for five years, came straight from her day job at a hospital after she got the call from a dispatcher that the Marker family needed her ASAP.

According to those in the world of professional nitpicking, Pediculus humanus capitis, the much-scorned head louse, has returned.

""It's definitely back,"" said Kelli Boswell, owner of Lice & Easy, a boutique where people in the Denver area can get deloused, a process that can range from minutes to hours depending on the method and the infestation. ""It's a sign that things are coming back to normal.""

Colds and more serious bugs like respiratory syncytial virus, better known by the shorthand RSV, are also back. That may leave some to wonder: With all the covid prevention measures in place, how are kids sharing these things?

Like the coronavirus, all these bugs depend on human sociability. Unfortunately, the measures that many reopened schools have taken to prevent the transmission of covid-19 — masks, hand-washing, vaccination — do little to deter the spread of the head louse. However, physical distancing, such as spacing desks 3 feet apart, should be helping, if it's actually happening.

Lice are, in theory, harder to spread than the SARS-CoV-2 virus because proximity alone isn't enough: They usually need head-to-head contact. If a kid gets lice, odds are it means that kid spent some quality time close enough to another kid for the parasite to make its move. (Researchers tend to agree that transmission via inanimate objects like combs and hats is minimal.)

The head louse is not known for its fortitude or athletic prowess. It's basically the couch potato of pests. Adults can't survive more than a day or two without snacking on blood. Their eggs can't hatch without the warmth of a human head, and will die within about a week if not in those cozy conditions. The bugs can't jump or fly — only crawl. The one thing going for the head louse is its highly specialized claws, evolved to grasp human hair.

Unlike the body louse, the head louse isn't known to spread disease. An infestation doesn't indicate anything about a person's hygiene. (In fact, the lore of delousers says that the bugs prefer clean hair because it's more grabbable.) And despite common misconceptions, they can colonize people of all ages, races and ethnicities.

Covid lockdowns were not great from a louse-world-domination standpoint. But the critters have been bonding with us for tens of thousands of years. A little lockdown wasn't going to end the romance.

Federico Galassi, a researcher with Argentina's Pest and Insecticide Research Center, found that strict early covid lockdowns did, indeed, lead to a decline in head lice among kids in Buenos Aires, but the bugs came nowhere close to being eliminated. His study found prevalence dropped from about 70% to about 44%.

And one thing is clear: When people shut their doors and hunkered down in early lockdowns, the lice were right there hunkered down with us. When SaLeah Snelling reopened the doors of her Lice Clinics of America salon in Boise, Idaho, in May, she said, ""the cases of head lice were heavier than we've ever seen."" And it wasn't just one or two people in the household with lice, but the entire household.

Now, Galassi and American louse workers say, infestation rates are back to pre-lockdown norms, despite school covid protections.

Nix, a brand of anti-louse products, publishes a map that claims lice are bad right now in Houston, most of Alabama and New Mexico, plus Tulsa, Oklahoma. The map directs people to locations that carry its products since many parents use a DIY approach once they spy the critter on a child's head.

Richard Pollack, chief scientific officer with pro-bono pest-identification service IdentifyUS, said most claims about louse prevalence are ""marketing nonsense"" from a largely unregulated industry focused on apparent infestations that often turn out to be just dandruff, glitter, hair spray, grass-dwelling springtail insects, innocuous fungus or even cookie crumbs.

It's possible that the recent increase in business for professional nitpickery suggests that people are now comfortable seeking help outside the home rather than its being a sign of a surge in the bugs.

While little research exists to confirm whether there is a rise in lice, Boswell, Pollack and even the National Association of School Nurses agree: The bugs aren't likely spreading in the classroom because in-school louse transmission is considered rare. Instead, Boswell said, it's more likely that as other activities resumed — sleepovers, play dates, summer camp, family gatherings — the bugs prospered once more.

Pollack once wrote in a presentation slide, ""Head lice indicate that the child has friends."" Preschoolers tend to get the infestations the most ""because they're more cuddly,"" said Julia Wilson, co-owner of Rocky Mountain Lice Removal in Lafayette, Colorado. But she has also noticed a rise among teenagers, which she ascribes to taking selfies with pals.

""You say to them, 'Have you touched heads?' and the teenager's like, 'No, never,'"" said Wilson. ""And then all of a sudden, they're literally taking a selfie photo with their friends.""

The Marker family isn't sure where third grader Huntley's lice originated. Perhaps a close friend or her dance team? The Markers spent more than $200 to get the four-person household checked — eyebrows and Dad's beard included. Her dad and her preschool-aged brother were free of nits. But Holmes did find a couple of nits on Huntley's mom, Paris.

""You can just burn my whole head right now,"" said Paris.

After combing each head carefully, Holmes ended the session by hugging her customers goodbye, proof that she trusts her work."

A new study says 700,000 to 1.6 million people in the United States who got COVID-19 may have lost their sense of smell for 6 months or longer.

That’s the conclusion of researchers at the Washington University in St. Louis who started the study after a growing number of patients reported their smell and taste months after they got over COVID.

""In the last couple of months, my colleagues and I noted a dramatic increase in the number of patients seeking medical attention for olfactory dysfunction."" Jay Piccirillo, the study author and an otolaryngologist at Washington University, told Gizmodo.

The researchers started by looking at the number of daily new cases of coronavirus reported by the COVID Tracking Project between Jan. 13, 2020, and March 7, 2021, according to a research letter about the study published in JAMA Otolaryngology – Head & Neck Surgery.

They worked in the incidence of acute COVID olfactory dysfunction (OD) at 52.7% (based on a recent meta-analysis) and the recovery rate from OD at 95.3% (based on a prospective study).

""This analysis of new daily cases of COVID-19, acute incidence of OD, and rates of recovery suggest that more than 700 000, and possibly as many as 1.6 million, U.S. individuals experience COD (chronic olfactory dysfunction) because of SARS-CoV-2,"" the study said.

These numbers include people who reported parosmia, or a distorted sense of smell that can make a normally pleasant smell, like that of fresh fruit, smell bad or rotten. Researchers cautioned that their numbers may well be an undercount as the pandemic is not over.

Other conditions besides COVID can cause COD, the study says. Adding 700,000 to 1.6 million COVID-related cases of COD represents a 5.3% to 12% relative increase in the total number of people with COD, they said.

And long-term loss of smell caused by COVID will hit the younger age groups harder, the authors said.

""COVID-19 affects a younger demographic group than other causes of olfactory dysfunction,"" the study said. ""Thus, the lifelong burden of olfactory dysfunction will be much greater for the COVID-19 cohort than for patients in the older age groups.""

57,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963361,health,"Even though younger patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) tend to be fitter and receive more intensive treatment than older patients, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) are remarkably similar between the two groups, according to a large phase 3 randomized trial.

""Colorectal cancer is on track to be the leading cause of cancer death in patients 20 to 49 by the year 2040, so it is important to understand survival in this population,"" lead author Marla Lipsyc-Sharf, MD, Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, told Medscape Medical News in an email. ""The most important point for oncologists to take away from our study is that the survival of young-onset colorectal cancer does not seem to be different from that in older patients.""

Previous studies comparing survival in younger versus older patients with metastatic CRC have yielded conflicting results. Lipsyc-Sharf and colleagues set out to clarify the literature in their large randomized study, published online on October 21 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

For the analysis, Lipsyc-Sharf and colleagues enrolled 2326 eligible patients in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)/SWOG 80405 (Alliance) trial to evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy plus a biologic to treat metastatic CRC. Slightly over 22% of participants (514 patients) were under age 50 at study enrollment, with a median age of 44.3 vs 62.5 years in those patients older than 50 years old.

The primary outcome was OS and secondary outcomes included PFS, defined as time from study entry until disease progression or death from any cause. At a follow-up of 6 years, median OS was 27.07 months in the young CRC cohort compared with 26.12 months in the older CRC cohort.

Similarly, median PFS in both younger and older cohorts was virtually identical at 10.87 months versus 10.55 months, respectively. Patients younger than age 35 did have a shorter median OS of 21.95 months and PFS of 9.33 months compared with 26.12 months and 10.55 months, respectively, for those 50 and older, but neither difference was significant.

The similar OS between the younger and older patients with metastatic CRC is ""particularly interesting,"" the authors note, given that younger patients should, in theory, have done better than their older peers. Younger patients tend to have better overall health (less diabetes, greater physical activity), more left-sided CRC (which is associated with a better prognosis), and receive more intensive therapy.

""It's not clear at this time why the young-onset CRC patients — despite having these more favorable characteristics — did not have improved survival compared to older patients,"" Lipsyc-Sharf said.

The authors suggest that this similar survival may be because younger patients tend to be diagnosed at more advanced stages, due to differences in underlying tumor biology, or due to other unknown factors. However, ""additional investigation into the tumor biology, clinical characteristics, and optimal treatment of patients with [early onset] CRC is essential,"" the authors conclude.

The work was supported by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health and, in part, by Bristol Myers Squibb, Genentech, Pfizer, and Sanofi. Lipsyc-Sharf has reported no relevant financial relationships.

58,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963363,health,"Two fifths of adolescents and young adults in the United States may have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), many with significant or advanced fibrosis, results of a nationwide surveillance study suggest.

In addition, among those who drink alcohol in excess, slightly more than half may have alcohol-associated fatty liver disease (ALD) that may lead to moderate to severe fibrosis in a substantial proportion, said Naim Alkhouri, MD, from Arizona Liver Health in Peoria, Arizona, during a presentation of the findings at The Liver Meeting 2021: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), held online.

""Efforts should focus on increasing awareness of the burden of ALD and NAFLD in this population and to mitigate modifiable risk factors to prevent disease development and disease progression to potentially advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis,"" he said.

Liver Stiffness Measured

Unlike previous studies that relied on liver enzyme levels or ultrasonography to estimate the prevalence of fatty liver disease among adolescents and young adults in the United States, Alkhouri and colleagues used valid liver ultrasonographic elastography (FibroScan) measurements, recorded during 2017–2018, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database.

The sample included participants aged 15 years to 39 years. Those with viral hepatitis, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels >500 U/L, or pregnancy were excluded.

The investigators divided the participants into those with excessive alcohol consumption, defined using the NHANES Alcohol Use Questionnaire as having more than two drinks per day for males or more than one drink per day for females, and those with no excessive alcohol consumption.

The authors used controlled attenuation parameters to identify participants with suspected ALD or NAFLD.

They then used liver stiffness measurement cutoffs of ≥7.5 kPa to identify moderate fibrosis and ≥9.5 kPa to identify severe fibrosis in those with evidence of ALD, and cutoffs of ≥6.1 kPa and ≥7.1 kPa, respectively, in those with suspected NAFLD.

The cutoffs were chosen to maximize sensitivity, as determined from published literature, Alkhouri said.

Uncovering a High Prevalence of ALD and NAFLD

The final sample comprised 1319 participants, including 100 with excessive alcohol use and 1219 without.

The heavy drinkers were significantly more likely to be older, male, White, current smokers, have lower platelet counts, higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ALT levels, and higher mean corpuscular volumes.

Among the excessive drinkers, 52% had ALD. Of this group, 87.7% had either no or mild fibrosis, and 12.3% had moderate to severe fibrosis.

Among patients with excessive alcohol consumption, significant predictors of ALD included male sex, higher body mass index, ALT greater than the upper limit of normal, and higher A1c percentage.

Among those who were moderate drinkers or abstemious, 40% had NAFLD. Of this subgroup, 68.9% had no or mild fibrosis, and 31.1% had moderate to severe fibrosis.

Predictors of NAFLD in this group included older age, male sex, higher body mass index, and elevated ALT, AST, albumin, platelet counts, and A1c.

Is Drinking Underreported?

In a question-and-answer session following the presentation, co-moderator Miriam B. Vos, MD, a pediatric hepatologist at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Georgia, asked Alkhouri about his confidence in the accuracy of the measurements of alcohol consumption and whether there could be significant overlap between the ALD and NAFLD populations.

Alkhouri noted that he and his colleagues relied on items 121 and 130 of the NHANES Alcohol Use Questionnaire, which are self-reported by participants.

""Obviously, we're not going to get honest answers all the time,"" he said. ""We've seen even in NASH [nonalcoholic steatohepatitis] clinical trials that when patients say they do not drink any alcohol, if you actually look for alcohol metabolites, up to 20% may have some evidence of alcohol consumption.

""I'm sure there's a lot of overlap, but there's no formal assessment,"" he added.

Alkhouri noted that among the cohort with ALD, obesity and increased A1c were prevalent, ""so it goes both ways. I think NAFLD can also contribute to progression of ALD, and that's why we need to study another entity called 'both alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.' ""

Vos suggested that biomarkers may be useful for detecting alcohol use among patients with NAFLD and for further study of the progression of NAFLD to ALD.

No source of funding for the study has been disclosed. Alkhouri and Vos reported no relevant financial relationships.

Nathan den Broeder

We could not formally statistically show that the lower doses were less effective than the higher dose,"" study leader Nathan den Broeder, MSc, a PhD candidate at St. Maarten Clinic and the Radboud Institute for Health Sciences in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, said in a presentation at the virtual annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology. ""We concluded at this time that only 6% of patients needed to switch to another biologic or targeted disease-modifying antirheumatic drug and that mean disease activity remained very low,"" he said of the patients treated with 200- and 500-mg doses of rituximab.

The extension study included 118 of 142 patients in the REDO trial, following them from the start of the trial in 2017-2018 through April 2021. They were randomized to three treatment arms: the standard 1,000-mg dose (24 patients), a 500-mg dose (n = 48), and the 200-mg dose (n = 46). The mean follow-up was 3.2 years.

The study evaluated disease activity by mean Disease Activity Score in 28 joints with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP), which during follow-up were 2.2-2.3 in the groups. Seven patients in the study cohort switched to a different DMARD, he said.

""On average, we saw a DAS28-CRP 0.15 points lower per 1,000 mg rituximab used in the past year,"" Mr. den Broeder said in an interview. ""For context, this is compared to a measurement error of about 0.6. A good response to a drug would be a reduction in DAS28-CRP of 1.2. This means we can just about get an effect that is bigger than the measurement error if we compare the highest dose in our study to the lowest one.""

After a year, the median yearly rituximab dose was 978 mg, with an interquartile range of 704-1,425 mg. At the end of the study, 31% of patients took 200 mg every 6 months, 40% took 500 mg every 6.2 months, and 29% took 1,000 mg every 6.4 months.

""It's important to note, though, this is in a situation where patients are given a dose based on disease activity,"" Mr. den Broeder said. ""That is, we try one dose; if the patient does well, we try a lower one; if not, we might go back up to a higher dose. We could expect somewhat larger differences if all patients were to be switched to a lower dose, regardless of whether that works well for them.""

The results were achieved without a high reliance on glucocorticoids (GCs), he said. Use of comedication in the extension study population was 0.38 GC injections per patient-year and starting or increasing an oral GC occurred at a rate of only 0.05 per patient-year.

""As a result of this study, we are now implementing a strategy of rituximab dose reduction in clinical practice at our center,"" Mr. den Broeder said. Patients with RA start on a 1,000-mg dose for 6 months, and if they respond well they're put on a 500-mg dose. If they respond well after 6 months on the 500-mg dose, they're then moved to the 200-mg dose. ""With this, we hope to gain that patients have fewer side effects,"" he said. ""We hope to reduce the cost of treatment, and also, what we instantly gain is that the infusion time for patients is also reduced.""

Future research considerations include evaluating the 200-mg dose as a subcutaneous injection. ""Another thing you might think of as well: Are even lower doses possible?"" he said.

Session moderator Maya Buch, MD, professor of rheumatology and director of Experimental Medicine at the Centre for Musculoskeletal Research at the University of Manchester (England), asked if the investigators used CD19 testing to measure B-cell levels or immunoglobulin G levels to determine dose escalation.

Mr. den Broeder said that CD19 wasn't used in clinical practice but was used in the original trial. However, it wasn't found to have any predictive ability, while immunoglobulin G levels were measured in patients who had multiple infections. ""Sporadically, a lower dose might have been initiated because of that, but not systematically,"" he said.

Mr. den Broeder had no relevant relationships to disclose. Dr. Buch reported financial relationships with AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Gilead Sciences, Merck-Serono, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi, and UCB.

60,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963362,health,"In response to a 911 alert or page, firefighters' systolic and diastolic blood pressure surges and their heart rate accelerates, with a similar response whether the call is for a fire or medical emergency, a small study suggests.

On average, the 41 firefighters monitored in the study, who were middle-aged and overweight, had a 9% increase in systolic blood pressure when called to a fire, a 9% increase in diastolic blood pressure when called to a medical emergency, and a 16% increase in heart rate for both types of calls.

Senior study author Deborah Feairheller, PhD, presented these results at the virtual American Heart Association (AHA) 2021 Scientific Sessions 2021.

Firefighters have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than the general population, Feairheller, director of the Hypertension and Endothelial function with Aerobic and Resistance Training (HEART) Lab and clinical associate professor of kinesiology at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, explained.

More than 50% of firefighter deaths in the line of duty are from CVD, she noted. Moreover, almost 75% of firefighters have hypertension and fewer than 25% have it under control.

The study findings show that all emergency and first responders ""should know what their typical blood pressure level is and be aware of how it fluctuates,"" Feairheller said in a press release from the AHA. ""Most important, if they have high blood pressure, they should make sure it is well controlled,"" she said.

""I really hope that fire departments everywhere see these data, rise to the occasion, and advocate for BP awareness in their crews,"" Feairheller, herself a volunteer firefighter, added to theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology in an email.

""I do think this has value to any occupation that wears a pager,"" she added. ""Clinicians, physicians, other emergency responders, all of those occupations are stressful and could place people at risk if they have undiagnosed or uncontrolled hypertension.""

Invited to comment, Comilla Sasson, MD, PhD, an emergency department physician who was not involved with this research, also saw parallels between stress experienced by firefighters and, for example, emergency department physicians.

The transient increases in BP, both systolic and diastolic, along with the heart rate are likely due to the body's natural fight or flight response to an emergency call, including increases in epinephrine and cortisol, said Sasson, who is vice president for Science & Innovation for Emergency Cardiovascular Care at the American Heart Association.

""The thing that is most interesting to me,"" she told theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology, especially as an ER doc who can have a series of high-stress situations on a shift, such as multiple trauma victims, a stroke victim, a person in cardiac arrest, is ""what is the cumulative impact of this over time?""

She wonders if ""having to be 'ready to go' at any time, along with disruptions in sleep/wake schedules, poorer eating and working-out habits when you are on shift, has long-term sequelae on the body.""

Stress-related surges in blood pressure ""could be a reason for worse health outcomes in this group,"" Sasson said, but this needs to be investigated further.

Firefighters With High Normal BP, High BMI

Feairheller and colleagues recruited 41 volunteer and employee firefighters from suburban Philadelphia and Dover, New Hampshire.

On average, the 37 men and four women had a mean age of 41 years, had been working as firefighters for 16.9 years, and had a mean body mass index of 30.3 kg/m2.

They wore an ambulatory blood pressure monitor during an on-call work shift for at least 12 consecutive hours.

In addition to the automatic readings, the participants were instructed to prompt the machine to take a reading whenever a pager or emergency call sounded or when they felt they were entering a stressful situation.

Over the 12-hour shift, on average, participants had a blood pressure of 131/79.3 mm Hg and a heart rate of 75.7 bpm.

When they were alerted go to a fire, their blood pressure surged by 19.2/10.5 mm Hg, and their heart rate rose to 85.5 bpm.

Similarly, when they were alerted to go to a medical emergency, their blood pressure jumped up by 18.7/16.5 mm Hg and their heart rate climbed to 90.5 bpm.

The surges in blood pressure and heart rate were similar when participants were riding in the fire truck to a call or when the call turned out to be a false alarm.

What Can Be Done?

""If we can increase awareness and identify specific risk factors in firefighters,"" Feairheller said, this could potentially ""save a life of someone who spends their day saving lives and property.""

To start, ""regular, in-station or home BP monitoring should be encouraged,"" she said. ""Firefighters should start to track their BP levels in the morning, at night, at work.""

""Being a volunteer firefighter myself, I know the stress and anxiety and sadness and heavy work that comes with the job,"" she said. ""I want to be able to do what I can to help make the crews healthier.""

Sasson suggested that ways to increase awareness and improve the health of firefighters might include ""counseling, appropriate breaks, possibly food service/delivery to provide better nutritional options, built-in time for exercise (gym or cardio equipment on site), and discussions about how stress can impact the body over time.""

It is also important to advocate for better mental health care, because people may have PTSD, depression, substance abuse, or other mental health conditions brought on by their stressful jobs.

""Also, it would be interesting to know what is the current state of health monitoring (both physical, mental, and emotional) that occurs for firefighters,"" she said.

The study was funded by the American Heart Association. The authors and Sasson report no disclosures.

61,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963356,health,"New evidence that women with breast cancer face an increased risk for atrial fibrillation (AF) comes from a multiethnic study of more than 85,000 older American women.

The incidence of new-onset AF was 0.6%, 2.1%, and 3.3% at 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year after a breast cancer diagnosis, compared with 0.2%, 0.9%, and 1.8%, respectively, among matched healthy women without breast cancer.

The rate of a new AF was highest in the first 60 days after a cancer diagnosis, increasing 0.6% every 30 days, and 0.3% every 30 days thereafter across 1-year of follow-up.

The increased incidence of AF was associated with higher cardiovascular mortality but not cancer-related mortality, lead author Avirup Guha, MD, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, reported at the virtual American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2021.

AF is the most typical arrhythmia noted in cancer patients, with an incidence that varied from 1.3% to 4.6% in previous Canadian and Danish breast cancer cohorts, he noted.

To examine the burden in the United States, Guha and colleagues used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database to identify 85,423 women at least 66 years old at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis, between 2007 and 2014, and propensity matched them 1:1 to Medicare beneficiaries without cancer.

In all, 2993 women developed new-onset AF after breast cancer diagnosis, 9425 had AF prior to cancer diagnosis, and 73,005 had no AF at 1-year follow-up, according to the results, also published in the European Heart Journal.

New-onset AF was more common in older women, those with cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and previous stroke, and among Black women. The age-standardized AF incidence was 49.9 per 1000 person-years in White women vs 58.8 per 1000 person-years in Black women in 2014.

""This finding is contrary to what is known from the general population, where the incidence of AF is known to be higher in Whites compared to Black females,"" the authors write. ""Although not wholly explained by our data, Black females have a higher likelihood of ER/PR- and later stage of a breast cancer diagnosis, which may be contributing factors.""

Women who did not receive surgery (23.5% vs 10.4%; P < .001) or radiation (66.5% vs 52.3%; P < .001) as first-line treatment had a higher risk of developing AF, as did those with advanced- vs early-stage disease at diagnosis (stage IV, 14.8% vs stage I, 6.3%; P < .001).

After traditional risk factors were controlled for, cancer stage stood out as a significant risk factor for AF, with adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of 1.51, 2.53, and 4.21 for stages II, III, IV, respectively, compared with stage I disease, Guha said.

Remarkably, left-sided breast cancer and breast cancer subtype based on receptor status (HER2Neu/HR) were not associated with AF risk, the authors note.

The risk for AF was lower in women treated initially with implanted radiation, also known as brachytherapy, than with beam radiation (aHR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.37 - 0.70). This is a novel finding and possibly due to a lower cardiac dose from radiation implants in the breast, the authors note.

Women who underwent more complex surgery, like modified radical mastectomy, compared with a simpler one, like lumpectomy, had a higher AF incidence (aHR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.31 - 1.85). Blood loss or electrolyte imbalance associated with longer surgery and the impact of cardiac fibrosis in late-stage cancer may explain the finding, the authors suggest.

Notably, use of cardiac medications — beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, and spironolactone/eplerenone — was associated with lower risk for AF in women with breast cancer across all grades (joint test P value > .05 for all three drug classes).

Increased Mortality

All-cause death was higher in women with new-onset AF after cancer diagnosis. At 1 year, 62.2% of women who developed AF in the first 30 days were alive, compared with approximately 85.0% of women who had AF prior to their cancer diagnosis. ""This [increased risk] is related to cardiovascular mortality but not to breast cancer-specific mortality,"" Guha said.

Cardiovascular mortality was threefold higher in women with incident AF in the first 30 days (aHR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.28 - 7.00), but not in those with AF prior to their cancer diagnosis (aHR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00 - 1.84).

The cause of cardiovascular death in patients with incident AF was heart failure (63.3%), systemic embolism (16.7%), ischemic stroke (16.7%), and arrhythmic (13.3%).

In an exploratory analysis, anticoagulant use was associated with lower all-cause mortality in women with incident AF (aHR, 0.43; 95% CI; 0.21 - 0.89).

""The present study supports the use of anticoagulants in breast cancer since AF was more associated with cardiovascular mortality than with cancer mortality,"" Jose L. Merino, MD, PhD, La Paz University Hospital, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, says in an accompanying editorial.

""This has important implications for the clinician who should be reassured to follow the general recommendations for AF thromboembolic prevention in this population,"" he said. ""The latter is particularly relevant because nowadays breast cancer patients with AF often do not receive anticoagulation despite having the indication for it.""

Merino noted that the overall results are not generalizable to all cancer patients, given the older age of the cohort, but joined Guha in calling for integrated management with cardio-oncology specialists and protocols, like the EHRA-PATHS project, to care for patients with breast cancer.

Commenting for theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology, Deepak Bhatt, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women's Hospital Heart & Vascular Center, Boston, said this is ""a very interesting analysis that highlights an overlooked association: a higher risk of atrial fibrillation in women after they are diagnosed with breast cancer.""

Some of this excess risk was driven by conventional cardiac risk factors, but breast cancer stage also appeared to increase the risk, he added. ""This latter finding may be due to cancer elevating cardiovascular risk in ways we are only now beginning to study and appreciate.""

""Intriguing associations, as in this study, are part of the reason that cardio-oncology is growing so rapidly,"" Bhatt observed. ""I suspect future research will find many interconnected pathways of thrombosis and inflammation that drive not only cardiovascular, but also cancer risk.""

The study was supported in part by National Institutes of Health grants and by the American Heart Association-Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Harold Amos grant. Guha is supported by an American Heart Association-Strategically Focused Research Network Grant in Disparities in Cardio-Oncology. Merino reports grants and personal fees from Abbott, Boston Scientific, Medtronic, Microport, and Sanofi.

62,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963358,health,"BETHESDA, Md. (AP) — President Joe Biden will briefly transfer power to Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday when he undergoes a ""routine colonoscopy"" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the White House said.

Biden drove early Friday to the medical center in the Washington suburbs for his first routine physical exam as president. Press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would be under anesthesia during the procedure and would transfer power to Harris.

""As was the case when President George W. Bush had the same procedure in 2002 and 2007, and following the process set out in the Constitution, President Biden will transfer power to the Vice President for the brief period of time when he is under anesthesia,"" she said. ""The Vice President will work from her office in the West Wing during this time.""

Biden, 78, had his last full exam in December 2019, when doctors found the former vice president to be ""healthy, vigorous"" and ""fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency,"" according to a doctor's report at the time. Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, is the oldest person to serve as president, and interest in his health has been high since he declared his candidacy for the White House in 2019.

Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who has been Biden's primary care physician since 2009, wrote in a three-page note that the then-presidential candidate was in overall good shape.

In that report, O'Connor said that since 2003, Biden has had episodes of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that's potentially serious but treatable. At the time, O'Connor cited a list of tests that showed Biden's heart was functioning normally and his only needed care was a blood thinner to prevent the most worrisome risk, blood clots or stroke.

Biden had a brush with death in 1988, requiring surgery to repair two brain aneurysms, weak bulges in arteries, one of them leaking. Biden has never had a recurrence, his doctor said, citing a test in 2014 that examined his arteries.

Pursuant to the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, Biden will sign a letter to the president pro tempore of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives saying he is unable to discharge his duties while under anesthesia, making Harris the acting president, and will send them another letter upon the conclusion of the procedure to resume his duties.

Harris, the first woman, person of color and person of South Asian descent to be vice president, will be making history during the short time she is serving as acting president. She is scheduled to travel to Ohio later Friday once Biden resumes his duties.

On Friday afternoon, Biden is scheduled to take part in the annual pardoning of the national Thanksgiving turkey.

When Biden took office he brought O'Connor back to the White House to continue serving as his doctor, and O'Connor was expected to lead a team of experts in conducting Biden's physical exam Friday.

Once the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, Biden's team took intense steps to keep the then-candidate and now-president healthy as the virus raged and took a disproportionate toll among older populations. Biden received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020 and his second dose just two weeks before taking office. He received a booster dose, which regulators say provides more enduring protection, in late September.

The White House said Biden would authorize the release of a medical report, as is customary for presidents and presidential candidates. Former President Donald Trump, 75, was sharply criticized for releasing only cursory details on his health while running and serving in the White House, including concealing the seriousness of his COVID-19 illness a month before the 2020 presidential election."

A surge in cases in the Upper Midwest has some Michigan schools keeping students at home ahead of Thanksgiving and the military sending medical teams to Minnesota to relieve hospital staffs overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients.

The worsening outlook in the Midwest comes as booster shots are being made available to everyone in a growing number of locations. Massachusetts and Utah became the latest to say anyone 18 or older can roll up a sleeve for a booster shots, and an advisory committee for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is meeting Friday to discuss expanding boosters.

Cold weather states are dominating the fresh wave of cases over the last seven days, including New Hampshire, North Dakota and Wisconsin, according to federal data. But the Southwest had trouble spots, too, with more than 90% of inpatient hospital beds occupied in Arizona.

In Detroit, where only 35% of eligible residents were fully vaccinated, the school district said it would switch to online learning on Fridays in December because of rising COVID-19 cases, a need to clean buildings and a timeout for ""mental health relief."" One high school has changed to all online learning until Nov. 29.

At another high school, some students and teachers briefly walked out Wednesday, saying classes still were too large for a pandemic and the school needed a scrubbing.

Detroit health officer Denise Fair Razo said new cases have skyrocketed in the city in the last 14 days to 3,858, compared to 2,322 in the previous two-week period.

""We're in Michigan so we're not finding ourselves spending time outdoors in flip-flops and tank tops,"" Fair Razo said Thursday. ""We are indoors and we're frankly becoming a little bit too relaxed. We're no longer wearing our masks. We're no longer washing our hands as frequently as we should. But we know these precautions.""

Fair Razo is urging people to get tested for COVID-19 before gathering at Thanksgiving, even if they're vaccinated. She ""absolutely"" predicts a post-holiday spike.

Elsewhere in Michigan, some schools are taking next week off for the Thanksgiving holiday instead of just three days.

""This school year has presented some major stressors that are noticed and recognized,"" Superintendent Greg Helmer told parents, citing staff shortages and student absences in Ravenna.

In Minnesota, the U.S. Defense Department will send two 22-member medical teams to Hennepin County Medical Center and St. Cloud Hospital next week to immediately treat patients and assist weary health care workers.

""I need Minnesotans to recognize, as we've been saying, this is a dangerous time,"" Gov. Tim Walz said in pushing vaccinations.

New Hampshire reported 327 people with COVID-19 in hospitals, passing its previous pandemic high from last Dec. 31. Neighboring Maine also hit a high mark for COVID-19 hospitalizations this week.

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott is calling legislators into a special session next week to pass a bill giving local governments the power to adopt temporary mask mandates. He has been opposed to a statewide mask order even as Vermont's new daily cases approach numbers not seen since the earliest days of the pandemic.

In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law that prevents businesses from ordering workers to be vaccinated unless they also allow them to opt out for a variety of reasons, including regular testing. Schools and local governments are barred from making vaccination mandates, and parents can sue schools over masks.

Florida lately has one of the lowest rates of new cases in the country. DeSantis has become one of the nation's most prominent Republicans through his opposition to lockdowns and other virus rules.

The U.S. is now averaging nearly 87,000 new coronavirus cases per day, up from 72,000 two weeks ago, and hospitalizations are starting to increase again after steadily falling since the peak of the summer delta variant surge. The country is still averaging more than 1,100 deaths a day, and the number of Americans to die from COVID-19 now stands at 768,000.

About 59% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, or about 195 million Americans. The government and health officials are urging more people to get vaccinated, especially the 60 million people who have yet to receive a first dose."

Here we go again.

Health experts are warning the U.S. could be headed for another COVID-19 surge just as we enter the holiday season, following a massive new wave of infections in Europe — a troubling pattern seen throughout the pandemic.

Eighteen months into the global health crisis that has killed 5.1 million people worldwide including more than 767,000 Americans, Europe has become the epicenter of the global health crisis once again.

And some infectious disease specialists say the U.S. may be next.

""It's déjà vu, yet again,"" says Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. In a new analysis published in The Guardian, the professor of molecular medicine argues that it's ""wishful thinking"" for U.S. authorities to believe the nation is ""immune"" to what's happening in Europe.

Topol is also editor-in-chief of Medscape, WebMD's sister site for medical professionals.

Three times over the past 18 months coronavirus surges in the U.S. followed similar spikes in Europe, where COVID-19 deaths grew by 10% this month.

Topol argues another wave may be in store for the states, as European countries implement new lockdowns. COVID-19 spikes are hitting some regions of the continent hard, including areas with high vaccination rates and strict control measures.

Eastern Europe and Russia, where vaccination rates are low, have experienced the worst of it. But even western countries, such as Germany, Austria and the U.K., are reporting some of the highest daily infection figures in the world today.

Countries are responding in increasingly drastic ways.

In Russia, President Vladimir Putin ordered tens of thousands of workers to stay home earlier this month.

In the Dutch city of Utrecht, traditional Christmas celebrations have been canceled as the country is headed for a partial lockdown.

Austria announced a 20-day lockdown beginning Monday and on Friday leaders there announced that all 9 million residents will be required to be vaccinated by February. Leaders there are also is telling unvaccinated individuals to stay at home and out of restaurants, cafes and other shops in hard-hit regions of the country.

And in Germany, where daily new-infection rates now stand at 50,000, officials have introduced stricter mask mandates and made proof of vaccination or past infection mandatory for entry to many venues. Berlin is also eyeing proposals to shut down the city's traditional Christmas markets while authorities in Cologne have already called off holiday celebrations, after the ceremonial head of festivities tested positive for COVID-19. Bavaria canceled its popular Christmas markets and will order lockdowns in particularly vulnerable districts, while unvaccinated people will face serious restrictions on where they can go.

Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, MD, says what's happening across the European continent is troubling.

But he also believes it's possible the U.S. may be better prepared to head off a similar surge this time around, with increased testing, vaccination and new therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and antiviral therapeutics.

""Germany's challenges are caution to world, the COVID pandemic isn't over globally, won't be for long time,"" he says. ""But [the] U.S. is further along than many other countries, in part because we already suffered more spread, in part because we're making progress on vaccines, therapeutics, testing.""

Other experts agree the U.S. may not be as vulnerable to another wave of COVID-19 in coming weeks but have stopped short of suggesting we're out of the woods.

""I don't think that what we're seeing in Europe necessarily means that we're in for a huge surge of serious illness and death the way that we saw last year here in the states,"" says David Dowdy, MD, PhD, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a general internist with Baltimore Medical Services.

""But I think anyone who says that they can predict the course of the pandemic for the next few months or few years has been proven wrong in the past and will probably be proven wrong in the future,"" Dowdy says. ""None of us knows the future of this pandemic, but I do think that we are in for an increase of cases, not necessarily of deaths and serious illness.""

Looking Back, and Forward

What's happening in in Europe today mirrors past COVID-19 spikes that presaged big upticks in cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S.

When the pandemic first hit Europe in March 2020, then-President Donald Trump downplayed the threat of the virus despite the warnings of his own advisors and independent public health experts who said COVID-19 could have dire impacts without an aggressive federal action plan.

By late spring the U.S. had become the epicenter of the pandemic, when case totals eclipsed those of other countries and New York City became a hot zone, according to data compiled by the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Over the summer, spread of the disease slowed in New York, after tough control measures were instituted, but steadily increased in other states.

Then, later in the year, the Alpha variant of the virus took hold in the United Kingdom and the U.S. was again unprepared. By winter, the number of cases accelerated in every state in a major second surge that kept millions of Americans from traveling and gathering for the winter holidays.

With the rollout of COVID vaccines last December, cases in the U.S. — and in many parts of the world — began to fall. Some experts even suggested we'd turned a corner on the pandemic.

But then, last spring and summer, the Delta variant popped up in India and spread to the U.K. in a third major wave of COVID. Once again, the U.S. was unprepared, with 4 in 10 Americans refusing the vaccine and even some vaccinated individuals succumbing to breakthrough Delta infections.

The resulting Delta surge swept the country, preventing many businesses and schools from fully reopening and stressing hospitals in some areas of the country — particularly southern states — with new influxes of COVID-19 patients.

Now, Europe is facing another rise in COVID, with about 350 cases per 100,000 people and many countries hitting new record highs.

What's Driving the European Resurgence?

So, what's behind the new COVID-19 wave in Europe and what might it mean for the United States?

Shaun Truelove, PhD, an infectious disease epidemiologist and faculty member of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, says experts are examining several likely factors:

Waning immunity from the vaccines. Data from Johns Hopkins shows infections rising in nations with lower vaccination rates.

The impact of the Delta variant, which is three times more transmissible than the original virus and can even sicken some vaccinated individuals.

The spread of COVID-19 among teens and children; the easing of precautions (such as masking and social distancing); differences in the types of vaccines used in European nations and the U.S.

""These are all possibilities,"" says Truelove. ""There are so many factors and so it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what's driving it and what effect each of those things might be having.""

As a result, it's difficult to predict and prepare for what might lie ahead for the U.S., he says.

""There's a ton of uncertainty and we're trying to understand what's going to happen here over the next 6 months,"" he says.

Even so, Truelove adds that what's happening overseas might not be ""super predictive"" of a new wave of COVID in the U.S.

For one thing, he says, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the two mRNA vaccines used predominantly in the U.S., are far more effective — 94-95% — than the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID shot (63%) widely administered across Europe.

Secondly, European countries have impose much stronger and stricter control measures throughout the pandemic than the U.S. That might actually be driving the new surges because fewer unvaccinated people have been exposed to the virus, which means they have lower ""natural immunity"" from prior COVID infection.

Truelove explains: ""Stronger and stricter control measures … have the consequence of leaving a lot more susceptible individuals in the population, [because] the stronger the controls the fewer people get infected. And so, you have more individuals remaining in the population who are more susceptible and at risk of getting infected in the future.""

By contrast, he notes, a ""large chunk"" of the U.S. has not put strict lockdowns in place.

""So, what we've seen over the past couple months with the Delta wave is that in a lot of those states with lower vaccination coverage and lower controls this virus has really burned through a lot of the susceptible population. As a result, we're seeing the curves coming down and what really looks like a lot of the built-up immunity in these states, especially southern states.""

But whether these differences will be enough for the U.S. to dodge another COVID-19 bullet this winter is uncertain.

""I don't want to say that the [Europe] surge is NOT a predictor of what might come in the U.S., because I think that it very well could be,"" Truelove says. ""And so, people need to be aware of that, and be cautious and be sure get their vaccines and everything else.

""But I'm hopeful that because of some of the differences that maybe we'll have a little bit of a different situation.""

The Takeaway: How Best to Prepare?

Dowdy agrees that Europe's current troubles might not necessarily mean a major new winter surge in the U.S.

But he also points out that cases are beginning to head up again in New England, the Midwest and other regions of the country that are just experiencing the first chill of winter.

""After reaching a low point about 3 weeks ago, cases due to COVID-19 have started to rise again in the United States,"" he says. ""Cases were falling consistently until mid-October, but over the last 3 weeks, cases have started to rise again in most states.

""Cases in Eastern and Central Europe have more than doubled during that time, meaning that the possibility of a winter surge here is very real.""

Even so, Dowdy believes the rising rates of vaccination could limit the number of Americans who will be hospitalized with severe disease or die this winter.

Still, he warns against being too optimistic, as Americans travel and get together for the winter holidays.

None of us knows the future of this pandemic, but I do think that we are in for an increase of cases, not necessarily of deaths and serious illness, Dowdy says.""

The upshot?

""People need to realize that it's not quite over,"" Truelove says. ""We still have a substantial amount of infection in our country. We're still above 200 cases per million [and] 500,000 incident cases per week or so. That's a lot of death and a lot of hospitalizations. So, we still have to be concerned and do our best to reduce transmission … by wearing masks, getting vaccinated, getting a booster shot and getting your children vaccinated.""

Johns Hopkins social and behavioral scientist Rupali Limaye, PhD, MPH, adds that while COVID vaccines have been a ""game changer"" in the pandemic, more than a third of Americans have yet to receive one.

""That's really what we need to be messaging around -- that people can still get COVID, there can still be breakthrough infections,"" says Limaye, a health communications scholar. ""But the great news is if you have been vaccinated, you are very much less likely, I think it's 12 times, to be hospitalized or have severe COVID compared to those that are un-vaccinated.""

Topol agrees, adding: ""Now is the time for the U.S. to heed the European signal for the first time, to pull out all the stops. Promote primary vaccination and boosters like there's no tomorrow. Aggressively counter the pervasive misinformation and disinformation. Accelerate and expand the vaccine mandates…

""Instead of succumbing to yet another major rise in cases and their sequelae, this is a chance for America to finally rise to the occasion, showing an ability to lead and execute.""

What to know:

How do biases about body size affect obesity research and what information do people accept as true? These are the questions asked by ""What's in a Number?"" a short documentary by Retro Report and Scientific American.

In 2005, Katherine Flegal, PhD, then a senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, led a study suggesting that the rate of annual deaths from obesity in the United States was about 100,000 – in contrast to a popularly cited statistic putting that number at 300,000 – and that people considered overweight had a longer life expectancy than those in the normal weight category.

However, Flegal's research was met with widespread criticism, and the figure of 300,000 annul deaths continues to be regularly cited in newspapers, medical journals, and legislation.

According to the documentary, results that seem to contradict the belief that thinner is always healthier are frequently labeled with the phrase ""obesity paradox,"" which always frames the results as unexpected.

Grouping results under the ""obesity paradox"" label can cause disbelief around findings and limit new research, says cancer researcher Bette Caan, DrPH, whose own research suggests that prioritizing retaining muscle during treatment is more important for patients with breast cancer than avoiding weight gain.

This is a summary of the article, ""The Weight Game: How Body-Size Bias Can Hold Back Health Science,"" published by Scientific American on November 18, 2021. The full article can be found on scientificamerican.com.

At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic's terrifying first wave in the spring of 2020, dozens of hospitals in high-incidence areas either planned or opened temporary, emergency field hospitals to cover anticipated demand for beds beyond the capacity of local permanent hospitals.

Chastened by images of overwhelmed health care systems in Northern Italy and other hard-hit areas,1 the planners used available modeling tools and estimates for projecting maximum potential need in worst-case scenarios. Some of these temporary hospitals never opened. Others opened in convention centers, parking garages, or parking lot tents, and ended up being used to a lesser degree than the worst-case scenarios.

But those who participated in the planning – including, in many cases, hospitalists – believe they created alternate care site manuals that could be quickly revived in the event of future COVID surges or other, similar crises. Better to plan for too much, they say, than not plan for enough.

Field hospitals or alternate care sites are defined in a recent journal article in Prehospital Disaster Medicine as ""locations that can be converted to provide either inpatient and/or outpatient health services when existing facilities are compromised by a hazard impact or the volume of patients exceeds available capacity and/or capabilities.""2

The lead author of that report, Sue Anne Bell, PhD, FNP-BC, a disaster expert and assistant professor of nursing at the University of Michigan (UM), was one of five members of the leadership team for planning UM's field hospital. They used an organizational unit structure based on the U.S. military's staffing structure, with their work organized around six units of planning: personnel and labor, security, clinical operations, logistics and supply, planning and training, and communications. This team planned a 519-bed step-down care facility, the Michigan Medicine Field Hospital, for a 73,000-foot indoor track and performance facility at the university, three miles from UM's main hospital. The aim was to provide safe care in a resource-limited environment.

""We were prepared, but the need never materialized as the peak of COVID cases started to subside,"" Bell said. The team was ready to open within days using a ""T-Minus"" framework of days remaining on an official countdown clock. But when the need and deadlines kept getting pushed back, that gave them more time to develop clearer procedures.

Two Michigan Medicine hospitalists, Christopher Smith, MD, and David Paje, MD, MPH, both professors at UM's medical school, were intimately involved in the process. ""I was the medical director for the respiratory care unit that was opened for COVID patients, so I was pulled in to assist in the field hospital planning,"" said Smith.

Paje was director of the short-stay unit and had been a medical officer in the U.S. Army, with training in how to set up military field hospitals. He credits that background as helpful for UM's COVID field hospital planning, along with his experience in hospital medicine operations.

""We expected that these patients would need the expertise of hospitalists, who had quickly become familiar with the peculiarities of the new disease. That played a role in the decisions we made. Hospitalists were at the front lines of COVID care and had unique clinical insights about managing those with severe disease,"" Paje added.

""When we started, the projections were dire. You don't want to believe something like that is going to happen. When COVID started to cool off, it was more of a relief to us than anything else,"" Smith said. ""Still, it was a very worthwhile exercise. At the end of the day, we put together a comprehensive guide, which is ready for the next crisis.""

Baltimore Builds a Convention Center Hospital

A COVID-19 field hospital was planned and executed at an exhibit hall in the Baltimore Convention Center, starting in March 2020 under the leadership of Johns Hopkins Bayview hospitalist Eric Howell, MD, MHM, who eventually handed over responsibilities as chief medical officer when he assumed the position of CEO for the Society of Hospital Medicine in July of that year.

Howell was chief medical officer for the Joint Commission-accredited Baltimore Civic Center Field Hospital for COVID-19 patients, opened in March 2020.

Hopkins collaborated with the University of Maryland health system and state leaders, including the Secretary of Health, to open a 252-bed temporary facility, which at its peak carried a census of 48 patients, with no on-site mortality or cardiac arrests, before it was closed in June 2021 – ready to reopen if necessary. It also served as Baltimore's major site for polymerase chain reaction COVID-19 testing, vaccinations, and monoclonal antibody infusions, along with medical research.

""My belief at the time we started was that my entire 20-year career as a hospitalist had prepared me for the challenge of opening a COVID field hospital,"" Howell said. ""I had learned how to build clinical programs. The difference was that instead of months and years to build a program, we only had a few weeks.""

His first request was to bring on an associate medical director for the field hospital, Melinda E. Kantsiper, MD, a hospitalist and director of clinical operations in the Division of Hospital Medicine at Johns Hopkins Bayview. She became the field hospital's CMO when Howell moved to SHM. ""As hospitalists, we are trained to care for the patient in front of us while at the same time creating systems that can adjust to rapidly changing circumstances,"" Kantsiper said. ""We did what was asked and set up a field hospital that cared for a total of 1,500 COVID patients.""

Hospitalists have the tools that are needed for this work, and shouldn't be reluctant to contribute to field hospital planning, she said. ""This was a real eye-opener for me. Eric explained to me that hospitalists really practice acute care medicine, which doesn't have to be within the four walls of a hospital.""

The Baltimore field hospital has been a fantastic experience, Kantsiper added. ""But it's not a building designed for health care delivery."" For the right group of providers, the experience of working in a temporary facility such as this can be positive and exhilarating. ""But we need to make sure we take care of our staff. It takes a toll. How we keep them safe – physically and emotionally – has to be top of mind,"" she said.

The leaders at Hopkins Medicine and their collaborators truly engaged with the field hospital's mission, Howell added.

""They gave us a lot of autonomy and helped us break down barriers. They gave us the political capital to say proper PPE was absolutely essential. As hard and devastating as the pandemic has been, one take-away is that we showed that we can be more flexible and elastic in response to actual needs than we used to think.""

Range of Challenges

Among the questions that need to be answered by a field hospital's planners, the first is 'where to put it?' The answer is, hopefully, someplace not too far away, large enough, with ready access to supplies and intake. The next question is 'who is the patient?' Clinicians must determine who goes to the field hospital versus who stays at the standing hospital. How sick should these patients be? And when do they need to go back to the permanent hospital? Can staff be trained to recognize when patients in the field hospital are starting to decompensate? The EPIC Deterioration Index3 is a proprietary prediction model that was used by more than a hundred hospitals during the pandemic.

The hospitalist team may develop specific inclusion and exclusion criteria – for example, don't admit patients who are receiving oxygen therapy above a certain threshold or who are hemodynamically unstable. These criteria should reflect the capacity of the field hospital and the needs of the permanent hospital. At Michigan, as at other field hospital sites, the goal was to offer a step-down or postacute setting for patients with COVID-19 who were too sick to return home but didn't need acute or ICU-level care, thereby freeing up beds at the permanent hospital for patients who were sicker.

Other questions: What is the process for admissions and discharges? How will patients be transported? What kind of staffing is needed, and what levels of care will be provided? What about rehabilitation services, or palliative care? What about patients with substance abuse or psychiatric comorbidities?

""Are we going to do paper charting? How will that work out for long-term documentation and billing?"" Bell said. A clear reporting structure and communication pathways are essential. Among the other operational processes to address, outlined in Bell's article, are orientation and training, PPE donning and doffing procedures, the code or rapid response team, patient and staff food and nutrition, infection control protocols, pharmacy services, access to radiology, rounding procedures, staff support, and the morgue.

One other issue that shouldn't be overlooked is health equity in the field hospital. ""Providing safe and equitable care should be the focus. Thinking who goes to the field hospital should be done within a health equity framework,"" Bell said.4 She also wonders if field hospital planners are sharing their experience with colleagues across the country and developing more collaborative relationships with other hospitals in their communities.

""Field hospitals can be different things,"" Bell said. ""The important take-home is it doesn't have to be in a tent or a parking garage, which can be suboptimal."" In many cases, it may be better to focus on finding unused space within the hospital – whether a lobby, staff lounge, or unoccupied unit – closer to personnel, supplies, pharmacy, and the like. ""I think the pandemic showed us how unprepared we were as a health care system, and how much more we need to do in preparation for future crises.""

Limits to the Temporary Hospital

In New York City, which had the country's worst COVID-19 outbreak during the first surge in the spring of 2020, a 1,000-bed field hospital was opened at the Jacob Javits Center in March 2020 and closed that June. ""I was in the field hospital early, in March and April, when our hospitals were temporarily overrun,"" said hospitalist Mona Krouss, MD, FACP, CPPS, NYC Health + Hospitals' director of patient safety. ""My role was to figure out how to get patients on our medical floors into these field hospitals, with responsibility for helping to revise admission criteria,"" she said.

""No one knew how horrible it would become. This was so unanticipated, so difficult to operationalize. What they were able to create was amazing, but there were just too many barriers to have it work smoothly,"" Krouss said.

""The military stepped in, and they helped us so much. We wouldn't have been able to survive without their help."" But there is only so much a field hospital can do to provide acute medical care. Later, military medical teams shifted to roles in temporary units inside the permanent hospitals. ""They came to the hospital wanting to be deployed,"" she said.

""We could only send patients [to the field hospital] who were fairly stable, and choosing the right ones was difficult."" Krouss said. In the end, not a lot of COVID-19 patients from NYC Health + Hospitals ended up going to the Javits Center, in part because the paperwork and logistics of getting someone in was a barrier, Krouss said. A process was established for referring doctors to call a phone number and speak with a New York City Department of Health employee to go through the criteria for admission to the field hospital.

""That could take up to 30 minutes before getting approval. Then you had to go through the same process all over again for sign-out to another physician, and then register the patient with a special bar code. Then you had to arrange ambulance transfer. Doctors didn't want to go through all of that – everybody was too busy,"" she explained. Hospitalists have since worked on streamlining the criteria. ""Now we have a good process for the future. We made it more seamless,"" she noted.

Susan Lee, DO, MBA, hospitalist and chief medical officer for Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, Nev., helped to plan an alternate care site in anticipation of up to a thousand COVID patients in her community – far beyond the scope of the existing hospitals. Hospitalists were involved the entire time in planning, design of the unit, design of staffing models, care protocols, and the like, working through an evidence-based medical committee and a COVID-19 provider task force for the Renown Health System.

Renown COVID-19 field hospital under construction in Reno, Nev.

""Because of a history of fires and earthquakes in this region, we had an emergency planning infrastructure in place. We put the field hospital on the first and second floors of a parking garage, with built-in negative pressure capacity. We also built space for staff break rooms and desk space. It took 10 days to build the hospital, thanks to some very talented people in management and facility design,"" Lee said.

Then, the hospital was locked up and sat empty for 7 months, until the surge in December 2020, when Reno was hit by a bigger wave – this time exceeding the hospitals' capacity. Through mid-January of 2021, clinicians cared for approximately 240 COVID-19 patients, up to 47 at a time, in the field hospital. A third wave in the autumn of 2021 plateaued at a level lower than the previous fall, so the field hospital is not currently needed.

Replicating Hospital Work Flows

""We ensured that everybody who needed to be within the walls of the permanent hospitals was able to stay there,"" said Lee's colleague, hospitalist Adnan (Eddy) Akbar, MD. ""The postacute system we ordinarily rely on was no longer accepting patients. Other hospitals in the area were able to manage within their capacity because Renown's field hospital could admit excess patients. We tried to replicate in the field hospital, as much as possible, the work flows and systems of our main hospital.""

When the field hospital finally opened, Akbar said, ""we had a good feeling. We were ready. If something more catastrophic had come down, we were ready to care for more patients. In the field hospital you have to keep monitoring your work flow – almost on a daily basis. But we felt privileged to be working for a system where you knew you can go and care for everyone who needed care.""

One upside of the field hospital experience for participating clinicians, Lee added, is the opportunity to practice creatively. ""The downside is it's extremely expensive, and has consequences for the mental health of staff. Like so many of these things, it wore on people over time – such as all the time spent donning and doffing protective equipment. And recently the patients have become a lot less gracious.""

Amy Baughman, MD, a hospitalist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, was co-medical director of the postacute care section of a 1,000-bed field hospital, Boston Hope Medical Center, opened in April 2020 at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. The other half of the facility was dedicated to undomiciled COVID-19 patients who had no place else to go. Peak census was around 100 patients, housed on four units, each with a clinical team led by a physician.

Boston Hope Medical Center, a 1,000-bed field hospital for patients with COVID-19.

Baughman's field hospital experience has taught her the importance of ""staying within your domain of expertise. Physicians are attracted to difficult problems and want to do everything themselves. Next time I won't be the one installing hand sanitizer dispensers."" A big part of running a field hospital is logistics, she said, and physicians are trained clinicians, not necessarily logistics engineers.

""So it's important to partner with logistics experts. A huge part of our success in building a facility in 9 days of almost continuous construction was the involvement of the National Guard,"" she said. An incident command system was led by an experienced military general incident commander, with two clinical codirectors. The army also sent in full teams of health professionals.

The facility admitted a lot fewer patients than the worst-case projections before it closed in June 2020. ""But at the end of the day, we provided a lot of excellent care,"" Baughman said. ""This was about preparing for a disaster. It was all hands on deck, and the hands were health professionals. We spent a lot of money for the patients we took care of, but we had no choice, based on what we believed could happen. At that time, so many nursing facilities and homeless shelters were closed to us. It was impossible to predict what utilization would be.""

Subsequent experience has taught that a lot of even seriously ill COVID-19 patients can be managed safely at home, for example, using accelerated home oxygen monitoring with telelinked pulse oximeters. But in the beginning, Baughman said, ""it was a new situation for us. We had seen what happened in Europe and China. It's a great thing to be overprepared.""

67,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963257,health,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Among postoperative patients at increased risk for complications, those who were sent to low-acuity floors rather than to the intensive care unit (ICU) had higher morbidity and mortality in a cross-sectional study.

""This study was prompted by recognition that after major surgery, high-risk patients are occasionally admitted to general wards with infrequent vital sign and bedside assessments, which allow postoperative complications to progress to severe illness between assessments,"" Dr. Tyler Loftus of the University of Florida Health in Gainesville told Reuters Health by email.

""Undertriage occurs when those providers underestimate a patient's risk for adverse events, and occasionally when ICUs are full and cannot accommodate additional patients,"" he said.

""Results from this study could be implemented in clinical settings by halting electronic order placement when those orders are triaging a high-risk patient to a general ward,"" he said. ""In these cases, the order could be escalated and reviewed by other providers, including those with critical care training.""

As reported in JAMA Network Open, Dr. Loftus and colleagues compared hospital morbidity and mortality among appropriately triaged ward admissions, undertriaged ward admissions and a risk-matched control group of ICU admissions.

Ward admissions were considered undertriaged if their estimated risk for hospital mortality or prolonged ICU stay (i.e.,48 hours or longer) was in the top quartile among all inpatient surgical procedures according to a validated machine-learning model available at surgical end time.

Among 12,348 postoperative ward admissions from University of Florida hospitals, 11,042 (89.4%; median age, 59; 54%, women) were appropriately triaged, whereas 1,306 (10.6%) were undertriaged and matched with a control group of 2,452 ICU admissions.

Compared with the control group, the undertriaged group was older (median age, 64 vs. 62), had increased proportions of women (49.7% vs. 44.0%), and had patients admitted with do-not-resuscitate orders before their first surgical procedure (4.1% vs. 1.1%). Ultimately, 207 undertriaged admissions (15.8%) had a subsequent ICU admission.

In the validation cohort of close to 21,000 admissions used to train the machine learning model, both hospital mortality and prolonged ICU stay estimations had areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92.

The undertriaged group, compared with the control group, had a similar incidence of prolonged mechanical ventilation (2.5% vs. 2.2%); decreased median total costs for admission ($26,900 vs. $32,700); increased median hospital length of stay (8.1 days vs. 6.0 days); and increased incidence of hospital mortality (1.5% vs. 0.7%).

The undertriaged group also had increased discharges to hospice (1.8% vs. 0.6%); unplanned intubation (3.4% vs. 2.0%); and acute kidney injury (26.1% vs. 19.5%), as well as increased incidence of procedures such as red blood cell transfusion, arterial catheter placement, and central venous catheter placement.

Dr. Loftus said, ""At surgery end time, machine learning algorithms can identify patients with high risk for adverse events who should be admitted to an ICU. Clinicians should also be aware of the opposite problem: overtriage of low-risk patients to ICUs. Low-risk patients occupying ICU beds can incur unnecessary expenses and create situations in which other patients with greater need of close surveillance are denied admission to a full ICU.""

Dr. Sherry Wren of Stanford University, coauthor of a related editorial, commented in an email to Reuters Health, ""It is exciting to see the development of real-time clinical decision tools leveraging machine learning and large EHR datasets. These data help inform clinicians on new variables to consider when making a decision on admission location.""

""As a surgeon, I typically determine admission location primarily based on procedure type, comorbid medical conditions, urgency, intraoperative hemodynamic stability, and whether pressors or blood transfusions were necessary,"" she said. ""Therefore, it was a surprise to learn that anesthetic gas concentrations and duration of inhalation agents (key features considered in the model's triage classifications) had such a strong effect on mortality and ICU stay. This opens up new discussions about this with my anesthesia colleagues.""

68,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963219,health,"LONDON (Reuters) - A sublineage of Delta that is growing in Britain is less likely to lead to symptomatic COVID-19 infection, a coronavirus prevalence survey found, adding that overall cases had dropped from a peak in October.

The Imperial College London REACT-1 study report, released on Thursday, found that the Delta sublineage known as AY.4.2 had grown to be nearly 12% of samples sequenced, but only a third had ""classic"" COVID symptoms, compared with nearly a half of those with the AY.4 Delta lineage currently dominant in Britain.

Two-thirds of people with AY.4.2 had ""any"" symptom, compared with more than three-quarters with AY.4.

AY.4.2 is thought to be slightly more transmissible, but it has not been shown to cause more severe disease or evade vaccines more easily than Delta.

The researchers said that asymptomatic people might self-isolate less, but also that people with fewer symptoms might spread it less easily through coughing and also may be unlikely to get severely ill.

""It is preferentially appearing to be more transmissible,"" Imperial epidemiologist Paul Elliott told reporters. ""It does seem to be less symptomatic, which is a good thing.""

Imperial had previously released interim results that showed COVID-19 prevalence was at its highest on record in October, with infections highest among children.

The full results of the latest round of the study, conducted between Oct. 19 and Nov. 5, confirmed what daily recorded cases and other prevalence surveys have shown - that infection levels dropped from that peak, corresponding with a half-term school holiday in late October.

Elliott said that there was uncertainty over whether that drop had continued, and the next few weeks would establish whether cases were rising again with the return of schools.

The REACT-1 study also found that booster doses reduced the risk of infection in adults by two-thirds compared with people who had two doses.

69,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963346,health,"A digital symptom monitoring system that allowed patients undergoing cancer treatment to report symptoms from home led to better symptom control, physical function, and quality of life, according to new research.

The study highlights that ""digital symptom monitoring with patient-reported outcomes is feasible, improves clinical outcomes, and is valued by patients and clinicians during routine cancer care,"" said lead author Ethan Basch, MD, FASCO, from the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill. ""It catches patient symptoms early, enabling clinicians to intervene and prevent downstream complications.""

The findings were presented virtually during the inaugural session of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Plenary Series.

Symptoms are common among patients undergoing cancer treatment but go undetected by clinicians up to 50% of the time. There are reasons why symptom reporting remains so challenging, Basch explained.

""If we consider the usual approach to symptom monitoring — a patient may have symptoms that need to be communicated, but when coming in for an appointment, there are hurdles that include limited time, competing topics, and patients and clinicians simply forgetting to bring up symptoms,"" he said. ""And when patients are home, they may be reluctant to contact their care team until symptoms become severe. [All of this] prevents the information from being communicated.""

Given these hurdles, there has been growing interest in integrating electronic patient-reported outcomes (PROs) into routine oncology practice to monitor symptoms. The idea is to detect symptoms early so clinicians can intervene, alleviate suffering, and avert complications.

However, evidence demonstrating clinical benefit of electronic symptom monitoring tools has been limited. A 2017 study that Basch and colleagues conducted at a single tertiary care medical center assessed whether electronic patient-reported symptom monitoring improved overall survival for patients with metastatic cancer in comparison with usual care. Although the researchers found an overall survival benefit for the PRO group, the study was limited in scope.

The current study expands on this initial research on both the endpoint and patient population fronts. The investigators evaluated not only overall survival but also key secondary endpoints, including satisfaction with digital monitoring, effects on physical function, health-related quality of life, and symptom control. The study included 52 US-based community oncology practices, which were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to digital symptom monitoring with PRO surveys or to usual-care control. The cohort included 1191 patients, with 593 patients at PRO practices and 598 patients at control practices.

Patients at the PRO practices completed a weekly survey either online or using an automated telephone system for up to 1 year. The survey included questions pertaining to nine common symptoms, performance status, and falls.

If patients reported severe or worsening symptoms, electronic alerts were triggered, and the patients were directed to care team nurses. Reports that tracked symptom data over time were available to oncologists during in-person or telehealth visits.

""A computer system can trigger reminders for patients by email or text to report their symptoms in real time,"" said Basch. ""This approach can enhance the connection between patients and clinicians.""

Although data regarding the primary endpoint of overall survival were ""not yet mature,"" Basch and colleagues found significant improvements in the secondary measures. As compared to those being treated at control practices, almost 14% more patients at PRO practices reported clinically meaningful benefits in physical function; 16% more reported better symptom control — including control of nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, appetite loss, fatigue; and 13.4% more reported improvements in health-related quality of life.

Patients completed over 91% of expected surveys. Of these, 34% generated alerts, most commonly for severe or worsening symptoms of pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, and/or nausea. Nurses responded to notifications related to severe or worsening symptoms 59% of the time. The responses generally involved calling the patients on the telephone to counsel them on symptom management, add medications for symptom relief, or set up new appointments.

""These results suggest a relatively simple approach to improving how we care for patients with advanced cancer receiving treatment and a range of future applications to further improve how oncologic care is delivered,"" commented Robert Dreicer, MD, MACP, FASCO, deputy director of the University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, who was not involved in the analysis.

The Right Endpoints

Commenting on the paper during the ASCO presentation, Debra A. Patt, FASCO, MD, PhD, MBA, executive vice president of Texas Oncology in Austin, noted that the main goals of cancer care aren't just to make patients live longer but also to live better.

""Supportive care offerings can be variable and, when left untended, greatly alter quality of life for patients,"" said Patt, who was not involved in the analysis. ""We know that by identifying symptoms earlier, it is amenable to a more rapid intervention.""

Patt pointed out that one strength of the study is that it focused on the right endpoints — patient function, health-related quality of life, and symptom control. ""One might say that we should wait for overall survival, but in my mind, the important endpoints are being discussed today,"" she said. ""Even if it comes to pass that there is not a survival benefit between the interventions, patients living better with chronic cancer matters.""

Patt also pointed to several open-ended questions and limitations. First, the study was conducted during the COVID pandemic, which ""could muddy the waters a little bit,"" she noted.

Second, Patt questioned whether digital innovations like electronic PROs will be able to close gaps in access to care, be readily implemented and optimized for patients, and be reimbursed by government payers and private insurance.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is considering incorporating symptom-monitoring tools into regular clinical practice in an oncology payment model. But while symptom management has been a clinical priority, it doesn't necessarily correlate with payment policy in the US.

""Failing to reimburse electronic PRO limits staffing and care delivery planning architecture to implement these solutions more broadly,"" Patt said.

70,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963343,health,"Federal health officials have outlined a five-part plan to improve and protect the mental health and well-being of America's healthcare workers (HCWs) and create sustainable change for the next generation of HCWs.

""It's long past time for us to care for the people who care for all of us and address burnout in our healthcare workers,"" US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, MD, said during a webinar hosted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), part of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""My hope is that going forward, we will be able to embark on this journey together to create a healthcare system, a healthcare environment, a country where we can not only provide extraordinary care to all those who need it, but where we can take good care of those who have sacrificed so much and make sure that they are well,"" Murthy said.

Burnout Is Not Selective

There are 20 million HCWs in the United States and no one is immune from burnout, said NIOSH Director John Howard, MD.

He noted that from June through September of 2020 — the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — 93% of HCWs experienced some degree of stress, with 22% reporting moderate depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.

Looking at subsets of HCWs, a recent survey showed that 1 in 5 nurses contemplated leaving the profession because of insufficient staffing, intensity of workload, emotional and physical toll of the job, and lack of support, Howard noted.

Physician burnout was a significant issue even before the pandemic, with about 79% of physicians reporting burnout. In the fall of 2020, 69% reported depression and ""a very alarming figure"" of 13% reported having thoughts of suicide, Howard said.

Women in healthcare jobs are especially vulnerable to burnout; 76% of healthcare jobs are held by women and 64% of physicians that feel burned-out are women, according to federal data.

""We have significant work to do in shoring up the safety and health of women in healthcare,"" Howard said.

Mental health is also suffering among local and state public health workers. In a recent CDC survey of 26,000 of these workers, 53% reported symptoms of at least one mental health condition in the past 2 weeks.

""That is really an alarming proportion of public health workers who are as vital and essential as nurses and doctors are in our healthcare system,"" Howard said.

Primary Prevention Approach

To tackle the burnout crisis, NIOSH plans to:

Take a deep dive into understanding the personal, social, and economic burdens HCWs face on a daily basis

Assimilate the evidence and create a repository of best practices, resources, and interventions

Partner with key stakeholders, including the American Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association, National Nurses United, the Joint Commission, and

Identify and adapt tools for the healthcare workplace that emphasize stress reduction

NIOSH also plans to ""generate awareness through a national, multidimensional social marketing campaign to get the word out about stress so healthcare workers don't feel so alone,"" Howard said.

This five-part plan takes a primary prevention approach to identifying and eliminating risk factors for burnout and stress, he added.

Secondary prevention, ""when damage has already been done and you're trying to save a healthcare worker who is suffering from a mental health issue, that's a lot harder than taking a good look at what you can do to organizational practices that lead to healthcare workers stress and burnout,"" Howard said.

71,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963340,health,"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has released a proposal for changing the reimbursement for lung cancer screening. The change would lower the age of eligibility for beneficiary reimbursement to 50 years (from the current 55 years).

Comments on the proposal can be made through December 16, 2021.

The move would bring Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement in line with current recommendations for lung cancer screening from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Medicaid coverage is currently uneven, and not all state programs cover it.

The USPSTF changed its recommendations for lung cancer screening earlier this year. In the updated final recommendations, the age at which screening starts was lowered from 55 to 50 years, and the criterion regarding smoking history was reduced from 30 to 20 pack-years.

That move nearly doubles the number of people who are now eligible for screening to 14.5 million individuals ― an increase of 81% (6.4 million adults) from their 2013 recommendations.

""This is great news because it means that nearly twice as many people are eligible to be screened, which we hope will allow clinicians to save more lives and help people remain healthy longer,"" commented John Wong, MD, chief science officer, vice chair for clinical affairs, and chief of the Division of Clinical Decision Making at the Task Force, at the time.

One difference between the USPSTF recommendations and the changes that CMS is proposing for reimbursement is the recommended age at which screening should end. The USPSTF recommends screening until age 80, while the CMS cutoff is age 77.

CMS also notes that before Medicare beneficiaries could undergo their first low-density CT (LDCT) screening for lung cancer, they would need to have a counseling and shared decision-making visit that meets the following criteria and is documented in the beneficiary's medical records:

Determination of beneficiary eligibility;

Shared decision making, including the use of one or more decision aids;

Counseling on the importance of adhering to annual lung cancer LDCT screening, the impact of comorbidities, and the ability or willingness to undergo diagnosis and treatment; and

Counseling on the importance of remaining abstinent from cigarette smoking if the patient is a former smoker or of the importance of smoking cessation if the patient is currently a smoker and, if appropriate, furnishing of information about tobacco cessation interventions.

Uptake Limited

The uptake of lung cancer screening is still very limited, ranging from 6% to 18% of individuals who meet the eligibility criteria.

""The science is clear that lung cancer screening has the potential to save lives,"" Wong from the USPSTF told Medscape Medical News in a past interview. ""We recognize that there are existing barriers to screening everyone who is eligible, but clinicians and patients both deserve to know that screening can detect lung cancer early, when treatment has the best chance of being beneficial.""

He added that it is hoped that these recommendations will encourage clinicians to examine the barriers to effective lung cancer screening in their communities and to do what they can to improve implementation. ""We also hope to encourage patients to have conversations with their clinicians about whether they are eligible for screening and to discuss smoking cessation treatments if they are still smoking,"" Wong added.

72,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963339,health,"Adding lithium to usual care does not decrease the risk of suicide-related events in those with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD) who have survived a recent suicidal event, new research shows.

The results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in veterans showed no apparent advantage of the drug in preventing self-injury, suicide attempts, or urgent hospitalization to prevent suicide.

""Lithium is an important therapy for bipolar disorders and depression subsets. Our study indicates that in patients who are actively followed and treated in a system of care that the VA provides, simply adding lithium to their existing management, including medications, is unlikely to be effective for preventing a broad range of suicide-related events,"" study investigator Ryan Ferguson, MPH, ScD, Boston Cooperative Studies Coordinating Center, VA Boston Healthcare System, Massachusetts, told Medscape Medical News.

The study was published online November 17 in JAMA Psychiatry.

Surprising Findings

The results were somewhat surprising, Ferguson added. ""Lithium showed little, or no, effect in our study compared to observational data and results from previous trials. Many clinicians and practice guidelines had assumed that lithium was an effective agent in preventing suicide,"" he said.

However, the authors of an accompanying editorial urge caution in concluding that lithium has no anti-suicidal effects.

This ""rigorously designed and conducted trial has much to teach but cannot be taken as evidence that lithium treatment is ineffective regarding suicidal risk,"" write Ross Baldessarini, MD, and Leonardo Tondo, MD, Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston.

Study participants were veterans with MDD or BD receiving care at one of 29 Veterans Administration medical centers who survived a recent suicide-related event. In addition to usual care, they were randomly assigned to receive oral extended-release lithium carbonate starting at 600 mg/day or matching placebo for 52 weeks.

The primary outcome was time to the first repeated suicide-related event, including suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, hospitalizations specifically to prevent suicide, and deaths from suicide.

The trial was stopped for futility after 519 veterans (mean age, 42.8 years; 84% male) were randomly assigned to receive lithium (n = 255) or placebo (n = 264). At 3 months, mean lithium concentrations were 0.54 mEq/L for patients with BD and 0.46 mEq/L for those with MDD.

There was no significant difference in the primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% CI, 0.77 - 1.55; P = .61).

A total of 127 participants (24.5%) had suicide-related outcomes — 65 in the lithium group and 62 in the placebo group. One death occurred in the lithium group and 3 in the placebo group. There were no unanticipated drug-related safety concerns.

Caveats, Cautionary Notes

The researchers note that the study did not reach its original recruitment goal. ""One of the barriers to recruitment was the perception of many of the clinicians caring for potential participants that the effectiveness of lithium was already established; in fact, this perception was supported by the VA/US Department of Defense Clinical Practice Guideline,"" they point out.

They also note that most veterans in the study had depression rather than BD, which is the most common indication for lithium use. Most also had substance use disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, or both, which could influence outcomes.

As a result of small numbers, it wasn't possible to evaluate outcomes for patients with BD, test whether outcomes differed among patients with BD and MDD, or assess whether comorbidities attenuated the effects of lithium.

The study's protocol increased participants' contacts with the VA, which also may have affected outcomes, the researchers note.

In addition, high rates of attrition and low rates of substantial adherence to lithium meant only about half (48.1%) of the study population achieved target serum lithium concentrations.

Editorial writers Baldessarini and Tondo note the low circulating concentrations of lithium and the fact that adherence to assigned treatment was considered adequate in only 17% of participants are key limitations of the study.

""In general, controlled treatment trials aimed at detecting suicide preventive effects are difficult to design, perform, and interpret,"" they point out.

Evidence supporting an anti-suicidal effect of lithium treatment includes nearly three dozen observational trials that have shown fewer suicides or attempts with lithium treatment, as well as ""marked, temporary"" increases in suicidal behavior soon after stopping lithium treatment.

Baldessarini and Tondo note the current findings ""cannot be taken as evidence that lithium lacks anti-suicidal effects. An ironic final note is that recruiting participants to such trials may be made difficult by an evidently prevalent belief that the question of anti-suicidal effects of lithium is already settled, which it certainly is not,"" they write.

Ferguson ""agrees that more work needs to be done to understand the anti-suicidal effect of lithium.

73,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963334,health,"In the 20 years since the first targeted cancer therapy was approved, more than 100 such products are now on the market or in development. These targeted drugs offer a different approach to the carpet bombing of chemotherapy — they are precise missiles, homing in on specific targets in the tumor's genetics.

But which targets? In which tumors?

Oncologists are increasingly concerned that the fire-hose of biomarker information now coming at them causes confusion, and worry that patients may be missing out on effective therapies.

A new database aims to change all that.

Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted its first recognition of a precision-oncology knowledge base linking genetic biomarkers to specific cancer types — the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's Oncology Knowledge Base (OncoKB).

""OncoKB's origins are rooted in the recognition that it was asking too much of clinical oncologists to memorize the rapidly growing number of tumor-type- specific cancer mutations that can act as predictive biomarkers to targeted therapies,"" said Debyani Chakravarty, PhD, Lead Scientist of OncoKB at the MSKCC's Center for Molecular Oncology.

""A clinical-decision support system to provide this information in the point-of-care setting was urgently needed,"" she added.

OncoKB made its public debut on May 16, 2017, with the publication of a paper by Chakravarty and colleagues in JCO Precision Oncology. At the time, the database boasted hand-curated levels of evidence for more than 3000 alterations in 418 cancer-associated genes and 19 cancer types. The roster is now 5685 alterations in 682 genes in 127 cancer types.

In October, OncoKB became the first tumor-mutation database to be included in the FDA's database recognition program.

Physicians or researchers can assess the evidence linking combinations of cancers, genetic biomarkers, and drugs through a simple interface.

""It's hard to figure out what is an actionable mutation and what is not without this kind of data,"" said Timothy Rebbeck, PhD, professor of cancer prevention at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, who was approached for comment.

He said the FDA nod for OncoKB makes sense: ""[It's] relevant for the FDA to be involved because of the treatment implications of these mutations.""

Many cancer genomic databases exist. The list includes MSKCC's own CBioPortal, as well as MyCancerGenome, the Precision Medicine Knowledge Base, Cancer Genome Interpreter, Cancer Driver Log, Tumor Portal, and others.

Chakravarty acknowledges that OncoKB is not alone. ""But that being said, it is now the first somatic human cancer variant database to be recognized by the FDA,"" she added.

At the heart of OncoKB is a rolling curation process involving more than 50 clinicians and geneticists at the cancer center. ""We have found a way to codify the scientific and medical expertise of MSK clinical oncologists"", said Chakravarty.

The team asks itself three deceptively simple questions: what the gene is, whether or not the mutation in that gene is oncogenic and, when found in a specific tumor type, the associated therapeutic implications.

The supporting data are then assigned an OncoKB therapeutic level of evidence on a scale that runs from ""standard care"" to ""hypothetical.""

""What surprised me most was, even just getting those three pieces of information and ensuring their accuracy was quite a challenge,"" Chakravarty said.

The new FDA recognition is deemed to be 'partial' because it does not cover all of OncoKB: the agency has not reviewed all the linkages between drugs and biomarkers on the site. However, the developers of OncoKB created — and submitted for recognition — an FDA-specific zone that lists oncology biomarkers that already have a regulatory green light.

The FDA-recognized zone of OncoKB provides similar data to the rest of the site, but it is categorized using the FDA's own level-of-evidence system.

The FDA assigns one of three levels of evidence to genetic variants in regulatory submissions that it receives. FDA Level 1 is reserved for approved companion diagnostics to targeted therapies; FDA Level 2 is assigned to ""cancer mutations with evidence of clinical significance""; and FDA Level 3 indicates ""cancer mutations with potential clinical significance"".

The FDA-recognized zone of OncoKB currently lists 46 actionable genes in 40 cancer types with FDA Level-2 evidence and 38 actionable genes in 33 cancer types with FDA Level-3 evidence.

The FDA first released guidance on how to achieve endorsement of genetic-variant databases in April 2018. Bearing in mind that cancer genomics is an enormous, energetic field, Medscape asked the FDA why it took 3½ years to recognize a tumor-mutation database.

FDA press officer Jim McKinney placed the onus on database developers to apply for official status: ""The FDA is unable to direct outside entities to apply with the FDA for database recognition,"" McKinney said. As for OncoKB, the review timeline was ""impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected agency resources.""

McKinney was not able to share how many other oncology genetic databases the FDA is currently considering for recognition. However, he did confirm that the partial FDA recognition of OncoKB means that ""test developers can use these data to support the clinical validity of tumor-profiling tests in premarket submissions.""

Chakravarty noted that commercial licensing requests, which historically have trickled in at a rate of one per week, ""spiked"" in the days following FDA recognition.

Chakravarty and Rebbeck have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

About half of all physicians will be sued at some point in their careers. It's a stressful and difficult experience no matter what the outcome. In addition to the time and expense, malpractice suits can take a heavy emotional toll on physicians personally, in their relationships with their patients, and with their families.

In Medscape's Malpractice Report 2021, more than 4300 physicians in 29 specialties shared why they were sued, the outcome, and how the ordeal affected their practice and their lives. For the most part, the results were similar to those of the previous survey (2019), but fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic did have some effect.

Roughly half (51%) of the new survey's respondents said they had been named in at least one lawsuit. The data in the 2021 report were similar to those of the 2019 survey, but COVID may have had an effect on the overall number of lawsuits. With fewer people undergoing medical procedures during the pandemic, the number of physicians who reported being involved in a lawsuit — either individually or as part of a group — dropped 6% for specialists before the pandemic and 10% for primary care physicians.

No physicians reported being involved in a COVID-related lawsuit, probably because pandemic-related executive orders granted immunity to healthcare workers. The most common reasons for lawsuits were consistent with previous surveys: failure to diagnose, and complications of treatment.

Surgeons, whether general or specialized, were more likely than other specialists to be sued. This is probably because surgeons typically don't have long-term relationships with patients and often perform high-risk procedures, according to J. Richard Moore, JD, attorney with Bleeke Dillon Crandall, in Indianapolis, Indiana.

Few Malpractice Cases Go to Trial

Most malpractice claims never make it to trial. In keeping with the results of Medscape surveys over the past 8 years, 33% of those surveyed said their cases were settled before coming to trial, while only 2% said that the case went all the way to trial and the plaintiff ended up winning.

Some specialties fare better than others. According to a landmark 2012 study, internists are the mostly likely subset of physicians to have their cases dismissed, pathologists the least likely. Catherine Flynn, JD, an attorney with Flynn Watts LLC, in Parsippany, New Jersey, says, ""There are some lawsuits that are warranted, but many times, it has more to do with the economic motivations of plaintiffs' law firms than a bad outcome.""

Generally, though, most physicians felt the end result of their case was fair. One internist said, ""Although this was a rare condition, there were at least two chances for me to catch it, and I failed."" However, not all were pleased with how things turned out. One surgeon said, ""The settlement wasn't my idea. I believe I would have prevailed in court.""

Despite generally favorable results, the process is time consuming and costly. The case can take more than a year ―40% of cases lasted from 1 to 2 years, a survey result that hasn't changed in 8 years. However, a backlog of cases due to the pandemic may soon extend that.

Physicians were often surprised to find that they were named in a malpractice suit. ""I was surprised by the suit because I was still caring for the patient, and the parents had never said anything,"" reported one otolaryngologist. That reaction is not uncommon, according to Moore. ""I think physicians would like to think there is some predictability in who files suit, but the reality is that you never know,"" he said.

Take Better Notes...and Don't Alter Them

For physicians, better charting heads the list of things to do differently next time. Careful and extensive documentation is one of the best practices for malpractice protection.

However, Michael Moroney, JD, an attorney with Flynn Watts, warns that going back after the fact and changing the documentation is a dangerous move. ""It can taint the rest of the case and prevent the jurors from believing that the doctor is telling the truth,"" he says.

While the experience was certainly not a pleasant one, fewer than one third of physicians surveyed believed the lawsuit negatively affected their careers, and more than half reported no career or attitude changes resulting from the experience, though for some who did, the changes were significant.

One rheumatologist reported that the experience ""interrupted my practice and family activities. It conditioned me to be more defensive in my practice and view every patient as a potential adversary."" One internist responded by giving up medicine and going to work for an insurance agency.

75,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963324,health,"Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic crises that require urgent care are alarmingly common in patients with diabetes and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who are on dialysis and greatly exceed reports in nondialysis patients with chronic kidney disease, a new nationwide retrospective study shows.

""These are high-risk, potentially life-threatening episodes — patients can die from these crises — and it's really important to recognize that this is not just low blood sugars, these are the most extreme cases that require external help to resolve the event — in this case emergency room care or hospitalization,"" first author Rodolfo Galindo, MD, associate professor of medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia told Medscape Medical News.

""So, these data represent a call for action for innovative and personalized strategies that can decrease these preventable — and in many cases iatrogenic — acute diabetes complications in this population,"" Galindo and coauthors stress.

""Our results confirmed that patients with diabetes/ESKD are vulnerable to large glycemic excursions and that the current standard of care for glycemic monitoring and treatment for this population is far from optimal,"" they add.

Asked by Medscape Medical News to comment on the study, Katherine Tuttle, MD, said that this is a ""critically important"" study that raises awareness about how common severe glycemic disorders, both hypo- and hyperglycemia are, among people with kidney failure treated by hemodialysis.

""Moreover, these data lead us to wonder about those who may not have made it to emergency care, in other words, the potential impact of such events on mortality outside the hospital,"" added Tuttle, professor of medicine, University of Washington, Spokane.

""The ""big issue,"" she said in her email, ""is the importance of identifying glycemic disorders and intervening before a crisis occurs.""

USRDS Registry

Galindo and colleagues used data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) registry to identify a total of 521,789 patients with diabetes and ESKD who had at least 3 months of dialysis prior to the index date and an established diagnosis of diabetes as of the index date (listed as either the primary cause of ESKD or as a comorbidity). Patients were enrolled in the registry between 2013 and 2017.

""The primary outcomes were emergency department visits or hospitalizations with a primary (first diagnosis) of severe hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic crises,"" the investigators note.

Rates were reported as the number of events per 1000 person-years. The median duration of dialysis upon cohort entry was 3 months and patients were observed for a median of almost 2 years. Over the study interval, 7.9% of patients experienced at least one hypoglycemic crisis, at an overall incidence rate of 53.64 per 1000 person-years.

""These rates are three to five times higher when you compare them to other studies in patients with renal failure but not yet on dialysis,"" Galindo emphasized.

Also very concerning, he added, was the incidence rate of hypoglycemic crises seen in the younger age group (patients aged 18-44 years) in which incidence rates ranged between 100 per 1000 person-years to 150 per 1000 person-years across the study interval — five times higher than incidence rates previously reported by others, he stressed (Table 1).

Women and Black patients similarly shouldered a high burden of hypoglycemic events, Galindo and colleagues point out.

Table 1. Adjusted Incidence of Hypoglycemic Crises

Patient group Incidence per 1000 person-years Aged 18-44 years 120.1 Aged ≥ 75 years 42.1 Females 56.3 Males 51.6 Blacks 60.0 Non-Hispanic Whites 54.0 Hispanics 46.3

Incidence rates of hypoglycemic crises actually declined between 2013 and 2017, dropping from 65.5 per 1000 person-years in 2013 to 45.1 per 1000 person-years in 2017 (P < .01).

""We are optimistic that trends are decreasing,"" Galindo said, ""but it was still concerning that the overall rates of hypoglycemia are the highest reported so far compared to other high-risk populations,"" he added.

Hyperglycemic Crises

Far fewer patients in this nationwide study experienced at least one hyperglycemic crisis between 2013 and 2017 at 1.8% overall, for an adjusted incidence rate of 18.2 events per 1000 person-years.

Younger patients again had the highest incidence of hyperglycemic crises at 102.4 events per 1000 person-years compared with only 2.6 events per 1000 person-years among patients 75 years of age and older.

The risk of hyperglycemia among females was again higher than it was among males at 22.2 events per 1000 person-years compared with 15.4 events per 1000 person-years.

However, and in contrast to hypoglycemic crises, non-Hispanic White patients had the highest rates of hyperglycemia, at 23.1 events per 1000 person-years, compared with 19.8 events per 1000 person-years among Black patients and 10.6 events per 1000 person-years among Hispanic patients.

Similar to what was seen with incidence rates of hypoglycemic crises, the incidence of hyperglycemic crises declined between 2013 and 2017, from 21.9 events per 1000 person-years in 2013 to 15.9 events per 1000 person-years in 2017 (P < .01).

As Galindo emphasized, many of these hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes are preventable.

""We found that over 63% of patients included in our study were receiving insulin therapy and insulin therapy was associated with a 34% increased risk for hypoglycemic crises compared to non-insulin therapy,"" he explained.

Of interest, insulin therapy also increased the risk of hyperglycemic crises by over 70%, again compared with other antidiabetic medications.

Episodes Are Preventable; Use of CGM Will Help

""This is why we say these episodes are preventable because using agents with a lower hypoglycemic risk [than insulin] is a better choice,"" Galindo stressed. Another strategy that could help optimize glycemic control is to use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with predictive hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia alarms.

In a recent nationwide study conducted in France, use of CGM decreased hospitalizations for acute glycemic crises by 40%-50% in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

""Concerns about cost and insurance coverage for CGM are valid but the burden and cost of emergency room visits, or hospitalizations must also be considered,"" Galindo pointed out.

""And educating patients and providers on how to prevent and treat hypoglycemia is paramount,"" he stressed.

Tuttle agrees that use of CGM and medication management ""to reduce the risk of hypo- and hyperglycemia are crucial areas for research that will directly impact care of patients treated by hemodialysis.""

""A multidisciplinary management team, including endocrinologists/diabetologists, pharmacists, and certified diabetes care and education specialist, and use of CGM should be incorporated in dialysis centers to help prevent these avoidable acute glycemic complications,"" Galindo and colleagues conclude.

The study was supported by the NIDDK of the National Institutes of Health. Galindo has reported receiving research support to Emory University for investigator-initiated studies from Novo Nordisk, Dexcom and Eli Lilly, as well as consulting fees from Abbott Diabetes Care, Sanofi, Valeritas, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Weight Watchers.

76,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963322,health,"Consumer advocates are up-in-arms over the announcement that Medicare premiums for physician and hospital outpatient services will increase by 15% in 2022, the result, in large part, of government uncertainty about whether it will have to pay for the Alzheimer's drug aducanumab (Aduhelm).

The $56,000-a-year infusion was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June over the objections of its advisory committee.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the Medicare Part B monthly premium will increase from $148.50 in 2021 to $170.10 in 2022, in part because of requirements that it have ""contingency reserves.""

""There is significant uncertainty regarding the potential for future coverage of clinician-administered Alzheimer's drugs (i.e., Aduhelm), requiring additional contingency reserves,"" the agency added.

Michael Carome, MD, director of the Washington, DC-based advocacy organization Public Citizen's Health Research Group, said the announcement was disheartening.

""All Part B Medicare beneficiaries soon will be forced to bear significant financial burden as a direct result of the FDA's reckless decision to approve aducanumab, a drug that has not been proven to provide any clinically meaningful benefit to Alzheimer's patients but nevertheless carries an indefensible annual price tag set by Biogen at $56,000 per year for just the drug alone,"" Carome said in a statement.

He added that CMS should ""promptly announce that it will exclude aducanumab from coverage,"" until there was substantial evidence that the drug provided cognitive benefit.



""Outrageous"" Pricing

The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) noted that the premium increase was the largest-ever for the Part B program.

""Once again, American seniors and taxpayers will pay the price for the outrageous pricing behavior of big drug companies,"" Bill Sweeney, AARP senior vice president for government affairs, said in a statement. ""When Big Pharma sets a high drug price, everyone pays for it — not just those who need the medications,"" he said.

Sales of aducanumab have not been anywhere near as robust as expected. In August it was reported that sales had been forecasted to hit $81 million in 2021 and $1.3 billion next year. However, Biogen reported revenues of $2 million in its second quarter ended June 30, and sales of $300,000 in its third quarter ended September 30.

The company said in its third quarter report that it ""assumes minimal Aduhelm revenue in 2021"" but that it is expecting revenue to increase in 2022.

Reuters also reported that Biogen was frequently providing aducanumab free of charge to clinics while it awaits Medicare's national decision on coverage. Some Medicare contractors are paying for the infusions in the meantime, Alzforum reports.

In another blow, it appears the drug will not be approved in Europe. As reported by Medscape Medical News, earlier this week the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency voted against approval of aducanumab at its November meeting, making it highly unlikely the drug will be recommended for approval at its December meeting.

77,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963243,health,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will limit large parts of public life in areas where hospitals are becoming dangerously full of COVID-19 patients to those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from the illness, a document showed.

National and regional leaders meeting on Thursday agreed the measure as part of their response to the fourth wave of the pandemic that is raging in Germany, overburdening hospitals in some areas.

In places where hospitalisation rates exceed a certain threshold, access to public, cultural and sports events and to restaurants will be restricted to those who have been vaccinated or who have recovered, according to the document seen by Reuters.

Saxony, the region hardest hit by the fourth wave, is already considering a partial lockdown, including closing theatres, concerts and soccer games, Bild newspaper reported. The eastern state has Germany's lowest vaccination rate and highest infection rate.

New daily infections have risen 14-fold in the past month in Saxony, a stronghold of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which harbours many vaccine sceptics and anti-lockdown protesters.

""This coalition is ready to now impose a hard and clear wave breaker,"" Saxony leader Michael Kretschmer told the national parliament, according to Bild.

The announcement comes in the same week Austria imposed a lockdown for the unvaccinated. Kretschmer said he did not believe targeting only the unvaccinated was enough.

Europe's latest coronavirus wave comes at an awkward time in Germany with conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel acting as a caretaker while three other parties negotiate to form a new government after an inconclusive election.

Those three parties shepherded a law authorizing measures to tackle the pandemic through the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) earlier on Thursday.

The law will tighten some measures currently in place, forcing people to show proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative test on public transport and at work, in addition to wearing face masks.

Separately, Germany's vaccine advisory committee recommended booster shots for everyone aged over 18.

Vaccinations have picked up in Germany, which has a history of vaccine resistance, although largely due to uptake of booster shots as more indoor gatherings due to colder weather raise the risk of spreading the virus."
78,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963226,health,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece on Thursday ordered private sector doctors in five regions in the north of the country to assist its health system as it grapples with a surge in COVID-19 infections.

The government had called on private sector doctors to help out earlier this month, as Greece's public hospitals and intensive care wards have been overwhelmed by rising infections in recent weeks.

The requisition order, published in the official government gazette, is effective for a month.

Greece reported 6,682 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday and 87 deaths, bringing total infections to 853,841 since the pandemic began last year, while 17,012 people have died.

Earlier in November, the government imposed restrictions to unvaccinated citizens in an effort to curb soaring infections.

Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is expected to address the nation later on Thursday, calling for more Greeks to get vaccinated.

About 61.8% of a population of about 11 million are fully vaccinated, while authorities had hoped for a rate of about 70% by autumn."

The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, will meet this afternoon to review the science supporting a more widespread need for booster doses, and is expected to vote on official recommendations for their use in the U.S. The CDC Director must then sign off on the panel's recommendations.

""As soon as the FDA reviews those data and provides an authorization, we at CDC will act swiftly,"" Walensky said at a recent White House briefing.

Several states — including Louisiana, Maine, and Colorado — have already authorized boosters for all adults as cases rise in Europe and across the western and northeastern regions of the United States.

FDA officials said they hoped that widening eligibility for boosters would cut down on confusion for people and hopefully speed uptake of the shots.

""Streamlining the eligibility criteria and making booster doses available to all individuals 18 years of age and older will also help to eliminate confusion about who may receive a booster dose and ensure booster doses are available to all who may need one,"" said Peter Marks, MD, PhD, who heads the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

80,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963286,health,"(Reuters Health) - People with single-sided sensorineural deafness who receive bone conduction devices experience improved hearing-related quality of life, but no change in general quality of life, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis suggests.

Researchers examined data from 11 studies with 203 adult participants who all had single-sided sensorineural deafness and underwent quality of life assessments before and after unilateral bone conduction device insertion.

The primary endpoint of the analysis was mean change in quality of life (QoL) scores six months after insertion of bone conduction devices. Quality of life assessments included the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) and the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ). Generic QoL was measured with the Health Utilities Index–3 (HUI-3).

Six months after bone conduction device insertion, researchers found a statistically and clinically significant improvement in both the global APHAB scores (mean change, 15.50). On the SSQ scores, researchers also found clinically and statistically significant changes on subscales for hearing qualities (mean change, 1.19), speech (mean change, 2.03), and spatial hearing (mean change, 1.51).

However, there was no significant change at six months in mean HUI-3 scores (mean change, 0.03).

""Although Bone conduction devices are an established form of treatment for conductive hearing losses or single-sided sensorineural deafness, studies exploring the individual non-hearing benefits of bone conduction devices in single-sided sensorineural deafness haven't shown improvement,"" said lead study author Thomas Hampton of the University of Liverpool in the UK.

Many previous studies evaluating the association of bone conduction devices with overall QoL in patients with unilateral and bilateral hearing loss looked at unvalidated measures, showed only modest benefits, or were underpowered, Hampton said by email.

""So not all clinicians agree on whether they provide patients with a meaningful QoL benefit,"" Hampton said.

There are several limitations to this meta-analysis, including the heterogeneity of QoL measures in the included studies as well as the lack of data on QoL at multiple points in time, the authors note in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery.

However, the results suggest that clinicians should look beyond general QoL and focus instead on hearing-related QoL when assessing the effectiveness of bone conduction devices for people with single-sided sensorineural hearing loss, the study team concludes.

""The real take-home is that improving quality of life is a good reason to recommend bone conduction devices to patients with single-sided sensorineural hearing loss,"" Hampton said. ""But clinicians and academics need to measure both hearing specific quality of life measures as well as generic measures because previously when using only generic quality of life tools, we may have been under appreciating the meaningful benefit patients receive from the devices.""

81,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963249,health,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted unanimously on Thursday to require wireless carriers to allow texting to the new ""988"" U.S. National Suicide Prevention hotline that will begin use by July 2022.

""For individuals in crisis, text messaging can make it easier to contact a crisis counselor by allowing for a certain level of anonymity rather than engaging in a phone conversation,"" the FCC said in a statement.

FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said ""millions of us, but especially young people and those with disabilities, are more likely to text than call when they are in crisis. The bottom line is it shouldn't matter if you make a voice call or send a text message because we should connect people in crisis to the resources they need, no matter how they communicate.""

The ""988"" three-digit code will direct calls to the existing suicide prevention helpline (800) 273-8255, which will also remain in service. There is a separate Veterans Crisis Line that people can reach at (800)273-8255 and will be able to reach through 988.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said U.S. suicide rates increased 33% between 1999 and 2019.

Deaths by suicide declined by 5.6%, from 47,511 to 44,834, between 2019 and 2020, according to early CDC data.

In 2019, 12 million American adults seriously thought about suicide, 3.5 million planned a suicide attempt, and 1.4 million attempted suicide, the CDC said.

The suicide prevention line consists of a national network of approximately 180 crisis centers linked by the toll-free number. In 2020, a total of 2.2 million calls were answered.

The FCC noted that some major carriers, including AT&T, are making ""988"" available ahead of the deadline.

The shift to ""988"" has impacted some local calling.

Starting last month, wireless users in many parts of the United States had to include the area code when dialing a local number."
82,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963225,health,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Across the U.S., only half of teens have received sex education that meets the minimum standard set in current national goals, a new study finds.

An analysis of survey data from nearly 8,000 teens reveals that when it comes to sex education, little changed between 2011-2015 and 2015-2019, with much of that education focusing on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV, researchers report in the Journal of Adolescent Health.

""Evidence shows that adolescents in the United States are clearly not getting the quality sex education they need, and in fact, our research shows that young people are less likely to receive information about birth control than they were 25 years ago,"" said Dr. Laura Lindberg, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute in New York City.

""Only half of U.S. adolescents get sex education that meet minimum federal standards, and many don't get any information at all on crucial issues like contraception and HIV prevention,"" Dr. Lindberg told Reuters Health by email. ""Adolescents aren't getting the information they need to have healthy and safe sexual lives as they enter adulthood.""

""There are also concerning inequities between who has access to sex education by race, gender, and sexual orientation that leaves young people vulnerable,"" she said. ""Withholding critical information about people's sexual health violates their right to accurate, timely information.""

Also concerning, Dr. Lindberg said, is the emphasis in many of the sex-education classes.

""Our research shows clear changes over time in young people's receipt of sex education,"" she added. ""Today, more adolescents have received instruction about 'how to say no to sex' (81% of females and 79% of males) than instruction about birth control (64% of females and 63% of males). By comparison, in 1995, 87% of female adolescents and 81% of male adolescents received education about birth-control methods.""

To take a closer look at sex education in the U.S., Dr. Lindberg and her coauthor, Dr. Leslie Kantor of Rutgers School of Public Health in Newark, New Jersey, turned to cross-sectional data from the 2011-2015 and 2015-2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Surveys of Family Growth (NSFG). The survey was designed to oversample Black and Hispanic individuals and teens aged 15-19.

For their analysis, the researchers focused on teens aged 15-19, which left them with 2,047 girls and 2,087 boys in 2011-2015 and 1,894 females and 1,918 boys in 2015-2019.

NSFG asked respondents: ""Before you were 18, did you ever have any formal instruction at school, church, a community center, or some other place about . . ."" The seven possible responses included: ""how to say no to sex,"" ""methods of birth control,"" ""sexually transmitted diseases,"" ""how to prevent HIV/AIDS,"" ""waiting until marriage to have sex,"" ""where to get birth control,"" and ""how to use a condom.""

In follow-up questions, teens were asked what grade they were in when they first received instruction and whether they got instruction before they first had sexual intercourse.

At both time periods studied by the researchers, more than 90% of female and male teens said they had received instruction on STDs or HIV, which was more than any of the other six topics examined in the study.

More teens received instruction on ""how to say no to sex"" (79%-84%) or waiting until marriage (58%-73%) compared with instruction about any of the birth-control topics, including the more actionable topics of where to obtain birth control (40%-53%) and how to use a condom (54%-60%).

Only about half of the adolescents met the Healthy People 2030 composite sex education goal (49%-55%). Among those not meeting the Healthy People goal, the most common issue was the lack of instruction on birth control methods (80% of respondents).

In 2015-2019, girls were more likely than boys to report receipt of specific instruction in waiting until marriage to have sex (67%), whereas boys were more likely to report instruction in condom skills (60% vs. 55%).

""Sex education is a critical part of education for adolescents, which means it needs to be funded at appropriate levels, be medically accurate, inclusive and comprehensive,"" Dr. Lindberg said. ""In order to move ahead, there also needs to be a more significant effort to build an equity focus into sex education policies and programs and eliminate troubling disparities in sex education by race and gender.""

There were no other significant gender differences in 2015-2019, in contrast to the 2011-2015 gender differences in instruction. The researchers found large declines in receipt of instruction about waiting to have sex (73%-67% for girls and 70%-58% for boys). There was also some evidence that an increasing number of boys were getting instruction on birth-control methods (58%-63%) and where to get birth control (40%-45%), but declines in the number of girls being taught where to get birth control for females (53%-48%).

83,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963224,health,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A new test that combines both the fraction and quantity of donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA), with the previously validated percent dd-cfDNA, is more sensitive in detecting active kidney-allograft rejection, compared to an older version of the test that used dd-cfDNA fraction alone.

The new Prospera with Quantification test, from Natera Inc, is the only available cfDNA test for kidney rejection that provides all three values (quantity, fraction and total cfDNA) on every report, according to a company press release.

""Total cell-free DNA is often elevated during viral infections and other complicated scenarios due to increases in the host-derived fraction,"" Dr. Suphamai Bunnapradist, a transplant nephrologist at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), said in the release.

""Consequently, the percentage of dd-cfDNA can be artificially depressed in these scenarios, leading to false negative results. The absolute quantification of dd-cfDNA in the sample is a game-changer as it makes the test more robust in challenging clinical scenarios, while boosting its sensitivity,"" Dr. Bunnapradist said.

Dr. Bunnapradist is first author on a new study in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology that assessed the test's performance in 41 kidney-transplant patients being managed at UCLA Medical Center.

Matched biopsy and dd-cfDNA test results were available for 16 patients; active rejection was found in nine of 16 (56%) biopsies, with five classified as T cell-mediated rejection, one as antibody-mediated rejection, and three as mixed type (antibody-mediated rejection/T cell-mediated rejection).

Compared with the original test, the new Prospera with Quantification test, incorporating the quantity of dd-cfDNA with the fraction of dd-cfDNA, improved the sensitivity of the test from seven of nine (77.8% sensitivity) to nine out of nine (100%) cases of active rejection, while maintaining high specificity, the authors report.

""Early detection of allograft rejection is critical to the successful management of transplant recipients. This test looks for damage really early on and is more accurate"" than the original test, Dr. Bunnapradist noted in a phone interview with Reuters Health.

Bernie Tobin, general manager of organ health at Natera, told Reuters Health by email, ""We encourage physicians to consider Natera's Prospera transplant assessment test for every kidney transplant patient to monitor the health of the allograft.""

""We know that this test can improve outcomes for patients,"" Tobin said, ""and within clinical practice, physicians are ordering the tests based on two scenarios: 1) Surveillance: The Prospera test may be used to monitor the health of the transplanted kidney at regular intervals, in the absence of any symptoms of active rejection. In a surveillance situation, we recommend testing at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months; 2) When clinically indicated: Here, the test is used by nephrologists considering the diagnosis of active rejection, helping to rule in or out this condition when evaluating the need for a biopsy.""

""Natera's Prospera transplant assessment test is covered by Medicare for all kidney transplants, including repeat transplants. We look forward to partnerships with commercial payers to ensure this test is accessible, available and covered for all transplant patients,"" Tobin told Reuters Health.

Natera sponsored the study. Dr. Bunnapradist and several coauthors report financial ties to the company.

84,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963223,health,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - An international panel of more than 40 healthcare professionals and legal experts has published the first guidance to support people with type 1 diabetes using open-source automated insulin delivery (AID) systems - also known as do-it-yourself (DIY) AID systems - to manage their condition.

""The medical and legal position of do-it-yourself and citizen science approaches have been subject to a lot of debate and uncertainty,"" co-lead author Dr. Sufyan Hussain of King's College London, who has lived with type 1 diabetes for over 30 years, said in a news release.

""This paper not only clarifies the position for do-it-yourself artificial pancreas systems in diabetes as a safe and effective treatment but sets a precedent for achieving an international professional consensus for other treatments based on user-driven do-it-yourself technologies and innovations,"" Dr. Hussain said.

The paper, online now in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, has been endorsed by nine professional diabetes organizations including the International Diabetes Federation.

The uptake of DIY automated insulin delivery systems continues to increase globally, ""with current estimates suggesting several thousand active users worldwide. Real-world user-driven evidence is growing and provides insights into safety and effectiveness of these systems,"" the panel writes.

DIY systems use community-generated algorithms to automatically calculate insulin dose in response to continuous glucose monitoring, insulin-pump data and additional information. The goal of DIY systems is to reduce both low and high blood sugar, but can also improve glycemic and long-term health outcomes, reduce diabetes distress and burden, and improve sleep quality.

DIY systems co-created by people living with diabetes are not regulated. The consensus paper provides professional validation and clear recommendations for their safe use, the panel says.

""Although we do not universally recommend the use of open-source over commercial AID systems, we propose that the best interest of the individual should be balanced against the risks of using open-source AID systems,"" the panel writes.

They recommend that clinicians work with patients to ensure safe and effective use of DIY systems and offer detailed guidance on how to achieve this.

Dominic Nutt, 54 from South West London, was diagnosed with diabetes at age 51. He has a personalized algorithm that controls his glucose monitor and insulin pump automatically, which he manages through a smartphone, entering when he eats carbohydrates or exercises.

""I'm not a techie at all, but since I was diagnosed, I've always been excited to try the latest developments as soon as they're available,"" he explains in the King's College London news release.

""A friend put me in touch with someone who could help me to personalize the algorithm to my diabetes and my insulin pump. I then worked with Dr. Hussain who helped me to make it work for my diabetes and the technology I was already using. It's been a revolution and a revelation. The swings in my blood sugar have gone. I used to have severe hypos needing emergency care about once every six months. Now that never happens, my blood sugar is under control, which has wider health benefits as well, plus I'm feeling fitter and stronger, and I don't have to eat as much sugar to control my blood sugar,"" Nutt said.

Hilary Nathan, UK policy and communications director at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, said in the release, ""JDRF UK welcomes this international consensus which is profoundly important to people who use Do-It-Yourself technology systems to manage their type 1 diabetes.""

""This international guidance has wider implications: citizen-led science has been shown to up-end the traditional treatment pathway which is traditionally research trials, followed by regulatory approval, followed by clinical guidance and then patient uptake. Dr. Hussain's work provides a new blueprint in developing an international consensus for healthcare guidance in the field of citizen and user development of health treatment technology,"" Nathan added.

85,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963199,health,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Sixteen out of 18 hemophiliacs infused with a genetically engineered virus no longer needed factor VIII to prevent unwanted bleeding nearly three years after a single treatment, researchers report in the New England Journal of Medicine.

""It really demonstrated the proof of principle that you could have multi-year stable and durable factor VIII expression, which has not been previously demonstrated,"" chief author Dr. Lindsey George of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia told Reuters Health by phone.

The investigational treatment, known as SPK-8011, uses a modified version of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) which carries a copy of the gene that holds the instructions for making factor VIII.

Once infused into the blood, the virus preferentially infects hepatocytes and, with the help of a promoter, ends up in the nucleus, where the DNA is used by the cell to churn out factor VIII.

The treatment is designed for people with hemophilia A, the most common form of the disease, which affects 15,000 people in the United States. If approved, it could replace intravenous infusions of factor VIII extracted from plasma or created from recombinant DNA technology.

But approval is not imminent.

The new results are from an ongoing phase 1-2 trial, in which the 18 men received one of four doses.

The two who lost factor VIII expression were in the high-dose group.

The good news is that both men started producing factor VIII, said Dr. George, director of clinical in vivo gene therapy at Children's. ""Unfortunately with the two men there was evidence four to six weeks later of a capsid immune response and we could not halt it with the use of immune suppression. Ultimately these men lost all factor VIII expression.""

But among the other recipients, factor VIII levels - which started out at 2% of normal or less - were at 12% after the therapy. And that was enough to produce a 91.5% drop in bleeding episodes.

Having less than 5% of normal factor VIII levels is considered moderate hemophilia and less than 1% is regarded as severe.

""So people were able to stop their baseline therapy and they were not bleeding. So that's overall great news,"" said Dr. George.

While the group had a median of 8.5 episodes per year before treatment, there were 0.3 events per year after.

The team says they have seen no major safety concerns.

Seven volunteers experienced elevations in alanine aminotransferase and in one case the elevation was considered to be a serious adverse event. The seven were receiving the highest doses of the therapy.

The treatment, if eventually approved, is expected to be extremely expensive, even though it doesn't have to be tailored to individual patients.

However, said Dr. George, ""hemophilia on an annual basis is quite expensive. For an adult male it's on the order of a half million dollars a year.""

Phase-3 testing of the therapy - one of several being developed by various teams using a similar strategy - has not begun.

""The sponsor is trying to figure out a way to use the right degree of immune suppression to ensure that all patients maintain expression,"" Dr. George said.

Spark Therapeutics, a Roche subsidiary that makes the vectors, originally released the data on July 21 in conjunction with the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis' virtual congress.

86,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963085,health,"(Reuters Health) - People who experience acute urinary retention are more likely to be diagnosed with prostate or urinary tract cancers in subsequent months, a recent study suggests.

Researchers examined data on 75,983 adults aged 50 and older who were admitted to the hospital with acute urinary retention between 1995 and 2017; most patients (82.6%) were male. The primary goal of the study was to assess the absolute risk of urogenital, colorectal, and neurological cancers among patients with acute urinary retention as compared with the general population.

Within three months of the diagnosis of acute urinary retention, researchers identified an excess cancer risk of 218 cases per 1,000 person-years for prostate cancer in men and 24 excess cases per 1,000 person-years for genital cancers in women. In addition, there was an excess risk at three months of 56 urinary cancer cases per 1,000 person-years, 12 colorectal cancer cases per 1,000 person-years, and 2 neurological cancer cases per 1,000 person-years.

""We conducted this study because we thought that acute urinary retention could potentially be a presenting sign of prostate cancer and some other cancers,"" said lead study author Dr. Maria Bisgaard Bengtsen of the department of clinical epidemiology at Aarhus University in Denmark.

""If so, admission with a first-time acute urinary retention could be an opportunity to diagnose an occult cancer,"" Dr. Bengtsen said by email. ""These cancers have been mentioned as theoretical causes of acute urinary retention in the literature, yet our study is the first to quantify this risk.""

The median follow-up period in the study was 3.3 years. A total of 27,410 people (36.1%) were followed for at least five years.

Patients had a median age of 76 years at the time of their first diagnosis of acute urinary retention. At this point, many of them had a prior urogenital diagnosis (48%), a previous neurological diagnosis (27.3%), or a had been diagnosed with diabetes (13.2%).

The excess risk of cancer following a first diagnosis of acute urinary retention was seen only for three months afterwards for several types of cancers studied, the study team reports in The BMJ.

However, at 12 months post-diagnosis there was still an excess prostate cancer risk of 21 cases per 1,000 person-years.

And, in women, there was an excess risk of urinary tract cancers from one to five years after a diagnosis of acute urinary retention, with 52 cases observed in this group compared with 28 expected cases based on findings from the general population.

One limitation of the study is that it included only patients admitted to the hospital for acute urinary retention, and it's possible some cases were treated in other settings, the authors note.

""We do not consider the association between acute urinary retention and cancer to be causal, and therefore treating or preventing urinary retention is unlikely to prevent cancer,"" Dr. Bengtsen said. ""Acute urinary retention is rather likely to be a presenting sign of occult cancer, which should therefore possibly be considered in patients aged 50 years or above with urinary retention and no obvious cause.""

87,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963308,health,"The American Gastroenterological Association recently published a Clinical Care Pathway for screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Recommendations are intended for a spectrum of clinical settings, including primary care, obesity medicine, gastroenterology, hepatology, and endocrinology practices, reported lead author Fasiha Kanwal, MD, of Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, and colleagues.

""Most patients with NAFLD and NASH [nonalcoholic steatohepatitis] are seen in primary care or endocrine clinics,"" the authors wrote in Gastroenterology. ""Although not all patients with NAFLD/NASH require secondary (i.e., hepatology) care, not knowing which patients might benefit from such care and when to refer them results in inconsistent care processes and possibly poor outcomes. Clinical Care Pathways, with careful explication of each step in screening, diagnosis, and treatment, have been shown to improve the quality of health care delivery in other areas of medicine, [and] are crucial to addressing the often inconsistent care processes characterizing current approaches to NAFLD/NASH.""

The guidance was drafted by a group of 15 multidisciplinary experts from around the world representing the AGA, the American Diabetes Association, the American Osteopathic Association, the Obesity Society, and the Endocrine Society. Recommendations were based on available literature and clinical experience.

The authors recommended a four-step screening process for NAFLD/NASH: Check for risk factors predicting clinically relevant fibrosis (stage F2 or higher), review history and perform relevant laboratory tests, conduct noninvasive liver fibrosis testing, and measure liver stiffness.

Patients at greatest risk for clinically significant fibrosis include those with two or more metabolic risk factors, those with type 2 diabetes, and those with incidentally detected steatosis and/or elevated aminotransferases.

""A recent retrospective cohort study found that patients with hepatic steatosis and elevated alanine aminotransferase had a significantly higher risk of progression to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma than patients with hepatic steatosis and persistently normal alanine aminotransferase,"" the authors noted.

When any of the above risk factors are present, the authors recommended checking the patient's history for excessive alcohol intake, conducting a complete blood count and liver function tests, and screening for other hepatic and biliary diseases, such as chronic hepatitis C virus infection and liver mass lesions.

If other liver diseases have been ruled out, the first step in liver fibrosis risk stratification involves noninvasive testing, with the authors favoring the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score ""because it has been shown to have the best diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis, compared with other noninvasive markers of fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.""

The next step in risk stratification involves liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with FibroScan (vibration controlled transient elastography [VCTE]), or newer modalities, such as bidimensional shear wave elastography or point shear wave elastography, which offer ""diagnostic performances at least as good as VCTE.""

According to the publication, patients with NAFLD at low risk of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 less than 1.3 or LSM less than 8 kPa or liver biopsy F0-F1) can be managed by one provider, such as a primary care provider or endocrinologist, whereas indeterminate-risk patients (FIB-4 of 1.3-2.67 and/or LSM 8-12 kPa and liver biopsy unavailable) and high-risk patients (FIB-4 greater than 2.67 or LSM greater than 12 kPa or liver biopsy F2-F4) should be managed by a multidisciplinary team led by a hepatologist.

Lifestyle intervention, weight loss (if overweight or obese), and cardiovascular disease risk reduction are advised for patients of all risk categories.

""There are no large, long-term behavioral modification or pharmacotherapy studies regarding weight loss in individuals with NAFLD,"" the authors wrote. ""However, weight loss of any magnitude should be encouraged as beneficial.""

For patients with indeterminate and high risk, NASH pharmacotherapy is recommended, and if needed, diabetes care should involve medications with efficacy in NASH, such as pioglitazone.

""Although we recognize that knowledge is continuing to evolve and that recommendations may change accordingly over time, we believe this Pathway provides accessible, standardized, evidence-based, timely, and testable recommendations that will allow clinicians to care for a rapidly growing population of patients, most of whom are managed in primary care or endocrine clinics,"" the authors concluded.

Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatic conditions, have a reduced serologic response to a 2-dose vaccination regimen with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, according to the findings of a meta-analysis.

""These results suggest that IMID patients receiving mRNA vaccines should complete the vaccine series without delay and support the strategy of providing a third dose of the vaccine,"" wrote study authors Atsushi Sakuraba, MD, of the University of Chicago Medicine, and colleagues in Gastroenterology.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns were raised about the susceptibility of patients with pre-existing conditions to infection with the novel coronavirus, the authors noted. Likewise, ongoing concerns have centered on the risk of worse COVID-19–related outcomes among patients with IMIDs who are treated with immunosuppressive agents.

Since the onset of the pandemic, several registries have been established to gauge the incidence and prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with IMID, including the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion (SECURE)–Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) registry and the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance 75 (C19-GRA), which includes patients with rheumatic diseases.

Authorization of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines provided hope that the COVID-19 pandemic could soon come to an end given the overwhelming safety and efficacy data supporting the use of these vaccines for preventing hospitalization and death. Despite these data, little is known regarding the efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in patients with IMIDs and/or patients treated with immunosuppressive therapies, as these patients were excluded from the regulatory vaccine studies.

The study by Sakuraba and colleagues was a meta-analysis of 25 observational studies that reported serologic response rates to COVID-19 vaccination in a pooled cohort of 5,360 patients with IMIDs. Data regarding the reference population, medications, vaccination, and proportion of patients who achieved a serologic response were extracted from the observational studies and included in the meta-analysis.

In the analyzed studies, serologic response was evaluated separately after one or two vaccine doses. The researchers also examined the post-vaccine serologic response rate in patients with IMIDs versus controls without IMIDs.

A total of 23 studies used the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines, while 3 studies reported that 50% to 75.9% of patients received the AZD1222 vaccine. Some studies also included patients who received other COVID-19 vaccines, including CoronaVac, BBV152, and Ad26.COV2.S.

While 6 studies assessed serologic response to COVID-19 after just 1 dose, 20 studies assessed the post-vaccination serologic response following 2 doses. In most cases, researchers evaluated serologic response at 2 to 3 weeks after the first dose. After the second vaccine dose, most studies examined serologic response at 1 to 3 weeks.

The serologic response after 1 dose of the mRNA vaccines was 73.2% (95% CI 65.7-79.5). In a multivariate meta-regression analysis, the researchers found that a significantly greater proportion of patients with IMIDs who took anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies had a lower serologic response rate (coefficient, –2.60; 95% CI –4.49 to –0.72; P =.0069). The investigators indicated this ""likely contributed to the difference in serologic response rates and overall heterogeneity.""

Studies with patients with IBD reported a lower serologic response rate compared with studies that included patients with rheumatoid arthritis (49.2% vs. 65.0%, respectively), which the investigators explained was likely reflective of the increased use of anti-TNF agents in patients with IBD.

After 2 doses of the mRNA vaccines, the pooled serologic response was 83.4% (95% CI, 76.8%-88.4%). Multivariate meta-regression found that a significantly greater proportion of patients who took anti-CD20 treatments had a lower serologic response (coefficient, -6.08; 95% CI -9.40 to -2.76; P <.001). The investigators found that older age was significantly associated with lower serologic response after 2 doses (coefficient, -0.044; 95% CI -0.083 to -0.0050; P =.027).

For the non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the rates of serologic response after 2 doses were 93.5% with AZD1222, 22.9% with CoronaVac, and 55.6% with BBV152.

Compared with controls without IMIDs, those with IMIDs were significantly less likely to achieve a serologic response following 2 mRNA vaccine doses (odds ratio, 0.086; 95% CI 0.036-0.206; P <.001). The investigators noted that there were not enough studies to examine and compare serologic response rates to adenoviral or inactivated vaccines between patients and controls.

In terms of limitations, the researchers wrote that additional studies examining humoral and cellular immunity to COVID-19 vaccines are needed to determine vaccine efficacy and durability in patients with IMIDs. Additionally, there is a need for studies with larger patient populations to determine serologic response to COVID-19 vaccines in the broader IMID population.

The researchers reported no funding for the study and no relevant conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry.

89,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963305,health,"The oral sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator ozanimod is significantly more effective than placebo for treating patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, regardless of prior biologic exposure, based on results of the phase 3 True North trial.

Dr Bruce Sands

Although improvements were seen across all patients, those who had previously used biologics took slightly longer to respond to treatment, which suggests that any initial improvements with ozanimod warrant continuation of therapy to achieve full effect, reported to lead author Bruce E. Sands, MD, of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, and colleagues.

""[Ulcerative colitis] patients previously treated with a biologic agent may be less likely to respond to another advanced treatment,"" Sands said during a presentation at the annual meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology.

Sands and colleagues evaluated this possibility in the True North trial, which previously demonstrated superior efficacy and safety of ozanimod over placebo through 1 year.

The present dataset included a double-blinded cohort of 639 patients (cohort 1), among whom 213 took placebo and 426 took ozanimod, and an open-label cohort of 353 patients who took ozanimod (cohort 2). Outcomes included clinical remission, clinical response, endoscopic improvement, and mucosal healing.

During induction (through week 10), biologic-naive patients in both cohorts generally responded better to ozanimod than those who had received at least one prior biologic. Patients who had received two or more biologics showed less improvement than those who had received only one prior biologic.

For example, in cohort 1, 53% of biologic-naive patients in the ozanimod group achieved a clinical response, compared with 50% of patients who had received one prior biologic, and just 27.2% of patients who had received two or more biologics.

With maintenance therapy, however, these differences faded. Among participants continuing ozanimod through week 52, 60.7% of biologic-naive patients achieved a clinical response, compared with 60.5% of those who had taken one prior biologic, and 55.3% of patients who had taken two or more prior biologics.

""Ozanimod treatment for up to 52 weeks in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis improved clinical symptoms, mucosal ulcerations, and reduced cellular inflammation in both biologic-exposed and biologic-naive patients,"" Sands concluded. ""Greater efficacy was observed in biologic-naive patients, followed by patients with prior exposure to one biologic, at induction; however, all groups had benefits at end of maintenance. Patients with prior biologic use may require additional time to respond to treatment.""

Dr Bradley Morganstern

Bradley Morganstern, MD, codirector of the IBD Center at Stony Brook (N.Y.) Medicine, called the study ""a really important analysis"" that addresses a common clinical decision.

""We often see a lower response rate among patients previously on biologics, but we have very limited data to guide us on how to choose a second-line agent,"" Morganstern said during an interview.

He said the current findings encourage use of ozanimod for patients who didn't respond to other biologics.

""The takeaway is that just because someone didn't respond to a biologic in the past doesn't mean they won't respond to this,"" Morganstern said. ""They actually have a very good chance of responding – similar to the rest of the population that was never on medication.""

He went on to explain that exact treatment sequencing remains unclear, although ozanimod is a strong candidate in the second line.

""We can't 100% say where it [ozanimod] fits in,"" Morganstern said, ""but we should certainly place it high up in the algorithm for patients who have failed a biologic. This should strongly be considered as a second-line agent.""

Morganstern said that he looks forward to long-term findings from True North beyond 1 year, ""in terms of maintaining response,"" and additional safety data.

The study was funded supported by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The investigators disclosed additional affiliations with AstraZeneca, AbbVie, Amgen, and others. Morganstern has previously spoken for Bristol-Myers Squibb.

90,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963304,health,"LAS VEGAS – New results from a single center, retrospective analysis suggest that individuals with diabetes and pancreatic cysts have larger cyst sizes at diagnosis, and a faster subsequent cyst growth rate. Smoking was independently associated with faster growth rate.

Dr David Robbins

Most pancreatic cancer patients were previously diagnosed with hyperglycemia and diabetes, and pancreatic cancer can cause diabetes. ""This sort of dual causality raises questions as to whether or not hyperglycemia, or the new diagnosis of diabetes itself, could be a harbinger of cancer or precancer. And should these patients be more closely monitored?"" David Robbins, MD, said in an interview.

Robbins, associate professor of medicine and program director in gastroenterology in the Northwell Health System, New York, presented the study at the annual meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology.

Faster growth rates of pancreatic cysts in the presence of diabetes are important because they represent a potential mark for cyst aggressiveness. ""So the question really is, in the setting of diabetes, are there factors perhaps circulating in the bloodstream, or other intrinsic factors, that make these cysts more dangerous and require a different surveillance approach than someone who doesn't have diabetes? We have (surveillance) guidelines that address the average population, but they don't really hone in on what do you do with (individuals with diabetes),"" Robbins said during the presentation.

The study could have implications for screening, said session moderator Dayna Early, MD, professor of medicine at Washington University and director of endoscopy at Barnes Jewish Hospital, both in St. Louis. ""I think this is important information to guide us to look more closely at patients with diabetes who do have pancreatic cysts,"" she said in an interview.

The study included 177 adults with pancreatic cysts or abnormal imaging results between 2013 and 2020. Sixty-five percent were female, and the mean age was 65.4 years; 64% were White, 10% were Black, and 8.5% were Asian. Among the participants, 24.8% were smokers and 32.2% had type 2 diabetes.

Patients with diabetes had larger cyst sizes (2.23 cm versus 2.76 cm), as well as a higher annual cyst growth rate (1.90 cm versus 1.30 cm). Cyst size and growth rate were similar between patients with controlled and uncontrolled diabetes. Smoking was associated with a larger cyst size overall (2.2 cm versus 1.81 cm), and were larger still among patients with diabetes who smoked (2.35 cm).

Seventy-one patients went on to have pathologic confirmation by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration. ""In the diabetic group, two developed adenocarcinoma, six of the nondiabetics developed adenocarcinoma, and there was no difference in CEA or serum CA 19-9,"" Robbins said during his presentation.

Of 28 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, 13 had type 2 diabetes.

Defining Danger

There remains uncertainty about what cyst growth rate is most dangerous. Some guidelines recommend that individuals with new-onset or worsening diabetes and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm or mucinous cystic neoplasm cysts, or cysts alone that are growing faster than 3 mm per year, may be at significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer. These guidelines recommend that they be screened with short-interval magnetic resonance imaging or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) fine needle aspiration. However, this recommendation is conditional and is backed by a very low level of evidence.

Other reports have shown varying risks at different growth rates. ""It's not really clear at this point. And that's why I think, while our study is small and exploratory, this is a particular area that is relatively easy to evaluate. We have huge databases of pancreatic cyst evolution, and we know that 30 million Americans have diabetes. So, the next obvious study is to do a more systematic look at that, and work towards refining and making sense of these divergent guidelines, all of which are saying the same thing but using different threshold numbers,"" said Robbins.

The next step is do larger, multicenter studies in the context of other risk factors such as family history and smoking, but the current finding represents an opportunity to catch at least some pancreatic cancers earlier, according to Robbins. He suggested that individuals with diabetes who are diagnosed with a pancreatic cyst should be referred to a gastroenterologist or another specialist to track cyst growth. ""That is going to miss a lot of folks who didn't get imaging for whatever reason (and so don't have a cyst identified), but it is an early opportunity, and it's better than what we're doing now.""

During the talk, Robbins said, ""Given the ease, availability and low cost of diabetes screening in the general clinic population, we encourage the inclusion of HbA1c and fasting glucose in algorithms for pancreatic cyst surveillance.""

Early found the suggestion intriguing, but wasn't ready to lend full support. ""I think looking at the suggestion of possibly monitoring hemoglobin A1c levels was novel. I don't know that we'll necessarily adopt that as standard practice, but that's something I think that could be looked at in the future as a way to help risk stratify whether patients need to be surveyed more frequently,"" she said.

Robbins and Early have no relevant financial disclosures.

91,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963303,health,"Erenumab, a calcitonin-gene related peptide receptor (CGRP) inhibitor, is more tolerable and effective than topiramate for treating patients with migraine, according to data from almost 800 patients in the first head-to-head trial of its kind.

Dr Uwe Reuter

The findings suggest that erenumab may help overcome longstanding issues with migraine medication adherence, and additional supportive data may alter treatment sequencing, reported lead author Uwe Reuter, MD, professor at Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and colleagues.

""So far, no study has been done in order to compare the efficacy of a monoclonal antibody targeting the CGRP pathway to that of a standard of care oral preventive drug,"" the investigators wrote in Cephalalgia.

The phase 4 HER-MES trial aimed to address this knowledge gap by enrolling 777 adult patients with a history of migraine. All patients reported migraine with or without aura for at least 1 year prior to screening. At baseline, most patients (65%) reported 8-14 migraine days per months, followed by 4-7 days (24.0%), and at least 15 days (11.0%). No patients had previously received topiramate or a CGRP-targeting agent.

""HER-MES includes a broad migraine population with two-thirds of the patients in the high-frequency migraine spectrum,"" the investigators noted. ""Despite a mean disease duration of about 20 years, almost 60% of the patients had not received previous prophylactic treatment, which underlines the long-standing problem of undertreatment in migraine.""

The trial had a double-dummy design; patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either subcutaneous erenumab (70 or 140 mg/month) plus oral placebo, or oral topiramate (50-100 mg/day) plus subcutaneous placebo. The topiramate dose was uptitrated over the first 6 weeks. Treatments were given for a total of 24 weeks or until discontinuation due to adverse events, which was the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoint was efficacy over months 4-6, defined as at least 50% reduction in monthly migraine days, compared with baseline. Other patient-reported outcomes were also evaluated.

After 24 weeks, 95.1% of patients were still enrolled in the trial. Discontinuations due to adverse events were almost four times as common in the topiramate group than the erenumab group (38.9% vs. 10.6%; odds ratio [OR], 0.19; confidence interval, 0.13-0.27; P less than .001). Efficacy findings followed suit, with 55.4% of patients in the erenumab group reporting at least 50% reduction in monthly migraine days, compared with 31.2% of patients in the topiramate group (OR, 2.76; 95% CI, 2.06-3.71; P less than.001).

Erenumab significantly improved monthly migraine days, headache impact test (HIT-6) scores, and short form health survey version (SF-35v2) scores, including physical and mental components (P less than .001 for all).

Safety profiles aligned with previous findings.

""Compared to topiramate, treatment with erenumab has a superior tolerability profile and a significantly higher efficacy,"" the investigators concluded. ""HER-MES supports the potential of erenumab in overcoming issues of low adherence in clinical practice observed with topiramate, lessening migraine burden, and improving quality of life in a broad migraine population.""

Superior Tolerability

Commenting on the study, Alan Rapoport, MD, clinical professor of neurology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and editor-in-chief of Neurology Reviews, said this is ""a very important, very well conducted trial that documents what many of us already suspected; erenumab clearly has better tolerability than topiramate as well as better efficacy.""

Dr Alan Rapoport

Rapoport, a past president of the International Headache Society, said the study highlights an area of unmet need in neurology practice.

""Despite most patients in the trial having chronic headaches for 20 years, 60% of them had never received preventive treatment,"" he said, noting that this reflects current practice in the United States.

Rapoport said primary care providers in the United States prescribe preventive migraine medications to 10%-15% of eligible patients. Prescribing rates for general neurologists are slightly higher, he said, ranging from 35% to 40%, while headache specialists prescribe 70%-90% of the time.

""How can we improve this situation?"" Rapoport asked. ""For years we have tried to improve it with education, but we need to do a better job. We need to educate our primary care physicians in more practical ways. We have to teach them how to make a diagnosis of high frequency migraine and chronic migraine and strongly suggest that those patients be put on appropriate preventive medications.""

Barriers to care may be systemic, according to Rapoport.

""One issue in the U.S. is that patients with commercial insurance are almost always required to fail two or three categories of older oral preventive migraine medications before they can get a monoclonal antibody or gepants for prevention,"" he said. ""It would be good if we could change that system so that patients that absolutely need the better tolerated, more effective preventive medications could get them sooner rather than later. This will help them feel and function better, with less pain, and eventually bring down the cost of migraine therapy.""

While Reuter and colleagues concluded that revised treatment sequencing may be warranted after more trials show similar results, Rapoport suggested that ""this was such a large, well-performed, 6-month study with few dropouts, that further trials to confirm these findings are unnecessary, in my opinion.""

The HER-MES trial was funded by Novartis. Reuter and colleagues disclosed additional relationships with Eli Lilly, Teva Pharmaceutical, Allergan, and others. Rapoport was involved in early topiramate trials for prevention and migraine, and is a speaker for Amgen.

For the single-center study, published in JAMA Surgery, researchers at Zhongshan Hospital and Fudan University in Shanghai performed whole-exome, targeted, and Sanger sequencing of samples from 1,024 patients (mean age, 59.2; 60.6% male) to identify KRAS variants.

Fourteen subtypes of KRAS somatic variants affecting 127 patients (12.4%) were identified.

G12D was the most frequent allele in the cohort, accounting for 55 of 127 (43.3%) variants. This was followed by G12V (19.7%), G12C (7.1%), and G13D (6.3%).

Compared with patients with wild-type KRAS, patients with variant KRAS were more likely to have high levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (72.4% vs. 60.9%) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (56.7%] vs. 46.8%).

Multivariable analysis showed that G12 KRAS variants, but not non-G12 KRAS variants, were independently associated with worse overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.69) and disease-free survival (HR, 1.47).

Among those with G12 KRAS variants, the G12V KRAS variant was the strongest prognostic determinant for worst overall survival (HR, 3.05) and disease-free survival (HR, 1.79).

The paper's corresponding authors did not respond to requests for comment.

Dr. Neena Vijayvergia, Assistant Chief, Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, told Reuters Health by email, ""Interesting to see the rate of KRAS alterations reported by the group was much higher than expected for ICC (3-5 % TCGA data). The association of KRAS G12V mutations with survival is a novel finding, but the numbers are small.""

""Since KRAS G12V mutations were associated with lymph node metastases, which in turn is a known strong prognostic variable, the clinical utility of such data is still lagging behind,"" she said. ""But this provides a way forward and is hypothesis-generating to develop future studies.""

Dr. Manmeet Ahluwalia, Deputy Director at Miami Cancer Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida, commented by email, ""This study highlights that there are differences in racial or etiological factors in patients from different ethnicities and backgrounds and it is critical that we perform more extensive molecular profiling in minorities, as most of the data in the Cancer Genome Atlas is derived from Caucasian patients.""

""As KRAS is now an actionable mutation and is amenable to being targeted with therapies that are designed for the KRAS alterations, pursuit of specific inhibitors of G12DKRAS and G12VKRAS in a precision oncology approach for patients with ICC needs to be explored.""

93,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963149,health,"LONDON (Reuters) - The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Wednesday that children aged between 12 and 15 should delay getting a COVID-19 vaccine if they've recently had COVID to at least 12 weeks after they were infected.

The advice brings guidance for 12 to 15-year-olds into line with that for 16 and 17-year-olds, who were advised to wait 12 weeks after infection before getting a shot when officials gave a go ahead for second doses for that age group.

Currently, 12 to 15-year-olds are only advised to get an initial shot of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, which has been associated with rare, mild and usually short-lived side effect of heart inflammation known as myocarditis.

The UKHSA said that the increase in the gap, from previous guidance of a 4-week interval, could cut rare cases of myocarditis further.

""The COVID-19 vaccines are very safe. Based on a highly precautionary approach, we are advising a longer interval between COVID infection and vaccination for those aged under 18,"" Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisations at UKHSA, said in a statement.

""This increase is based on the latest reports from the UK and other countries, which may suggest that leaving a longer interval between infection and vaccination will further reduce the already very small risk of myocarditis in younger age groups.""

Children have had some of the highest rates of infection in England since schools went back at the start of September, although prevalence has fallen from its peak since a half-term school holiday at the end of October.

UKHSA said that current advice for at-risk children between 12-17 was unchanged, owing to their higher risk from COVID which would outweigh any benefit from delaying the shots."
94,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/963111,health,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - More children are in hospital with breathing problems as pollution levels remain dangerously high in New Delhi, doctors warned on Wednesday, and the government shut five power stations and extended school closures to try to contain the crisis.

The city of 20 million was the world's most polluted capital for the third straight year in 2020, according to IQAir, a Swiss group, and air quality has hit hazardous levels there and in other parts of northern India this month.

On some cloudless mornings the sun struggles to break through the smog, and landmarks just a few hundred metres away are barely visible.

Hospitals are seeing a sharp increase in the number of children with respiratory complaints, raising concern among parents and doctors about their health in the short and long term.

Numbers have jumped threefold in the past seven to 10 days, according to Arvind Bountra, head of paediatrics at Max Super Speciality Hospital.

""This is directly linked to high levels of pollution that the city of Delhi and NCR are witnessing..."" Bountra said, referring to the National Capital Region that includes Delhi's satellite cities.

Extended exposure to pollutants, including lead, could lead to more severe complications.

""There is some study that shows that the cognitive functions of the brain (among kids) are also affected by these very small particles,"" Bountra added.

On most days, the Air Quality Index (AQI) has stayed above 451 on a scale of 500, indicating ""very poor"" and ""severe"" conditions that affect even healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases, according to the federal pollution control board's guidance.

The AQI measures the concentration of poisonous particulate matter PM2.5 in a cubic metre of air. The government prescribes a ""safe"" PM2.5 reading at 60 micrograms per cubic meter of air over a period of 24 hours.

TRUCKS STOPPED, CONSTRUCTION HALTED

India's Supreme Court has rapped the government over its failure to mitigate pollution for residents who endure toxic air almost every winter when temperatures and wind speed drop and pollutants get trapped in thick smog.

The country's top court also asked the Commission for Air Quality Management, a panel under the federal Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, to come up with measures to cut pollution.

After the Court's intervention, the Commission on Wednesday shut down five coal-fired power plants around New Delhi, banned trucks carrying non-essential goods and stopped construction in the capital and its satellite cities.

The panel also indefinitely extended the closure of schools, after the Delhi government ordered them to shut for a week last Saturday.

At least half of government employees should work from home until Nov. 21, it added.

November usually brings worsening pollution, with a surge in the concentration of tiny airborne particles, partly because farmers burn crop waste ahead of a new sowing season.

India's efforts to reduce the burning of crop waste, a major source of air pollution during winter, have had little benefit, despite spending billions of rupees over the past four years."

The pilot ejected and has been picked up and returned safely to the carrier.

The F-35B short-take-off, vertical-landing jet was one of eight British aircraft deployed on the Queen Elizabeth as it returned from a deployment in the Far East. The aircraft is one of 24 so far delivered to the British. The British are ordering 48 jets so far but have pledged to purchase 138, although that number is likely to be cut.

Ten US Marine F-35B’s are also deployed on the carrier.

The MoD said the crash occurred at 10:00 GMT during a routine operation from the carrier. No other aircraft were involved.

HMS Queen Elizabeth is on its maiden operational deployment, acting as the centerpiece of a British-led carrier strike group including U.S. and Dutch warships.

An investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing, the MoD said on Wednesday."
1,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/11/16/american-official-us-fully-committed-to-f-35-sale-to-uae/,defense,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The U.S. remains “fully committed” to a proposed sale of advanced F-35 stealth fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates, despite the Biden administration slowing down the deal, a senior American official overseeing arms exports said Tuesday.

Mira Resnick, a deputy U.S. assistant secretary of state in the Biden administration, also told the Associated Press at the Dubai Air Show that Gulf Arab partners are not looking to purchase weapons from Russia as a hedge over American concerns about human rights in the region.

A high-level Russian delegation met Tuesday with Abu Dhabi’s powerful crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, at the air show, which prominently featured Moscow’s competitor to the F-35, the Sukhoi Su-75 Checkmate.

“The F-35 is already in this region, whether it’s Israelis flying the F-35, whether it’s American F-35,” Resnick said. “We would like the UAE to be able to operate the F-35 in a way that (they) can be our security partners and to deter threats, including from Iran.”

The proposed sale of 50 F-35s came at the end of President Donald Trump’s administration, rising out of a deal that saw the UAE recognize Israel. The $23 billion sale also included armed drones and other defense equipment sought by the Emirates, a hereditarily ruled federation of seven sheikhdoms also home to Dubai.

After President Joe Biden came into office, his new administration put the arms sale and others on hold. That in part came over criticism of the UAE and Saudi Arabia over their yearslong war in Yemen, which has sparked the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and rages on today.

Only Israel flies the F-35 in the region, part of its so-called “qualitative edge” granted by America after Israel fought several wars against its Arab neighbors since its founding.

Resnick said she’d heard no concerns from Israel or other allies over the F-35 sale to the Emirates.

“We are fully committed to the F-35 and transferring the F-35, which is a game changer for the Emiratis,” she said. “We are working with them as we speak to make sure that there are clarifications to the various assurances that were made to the previous administration.”

Resnick declined to describe what clarifications America sought, nor what assurances the Emiratis had offered. The UAE similarly has not discussed sale terms.

Human rights concerns also have affected weapons sales to neighboring Saudi Arabia under the Biden administration. Biden himself pledged during his campaign to make Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman a “pariah” after U.S. intelligence agencies said they believe he ordered the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

“We have worked with with Saudi Arabia to make sure that they are able to defend themselves. We know that there are complications in ... this relationship and in relationships around the globe,” Resnick said. “But we continue to reinvest and make sure that they can invest in their own defense.”

Fragments of American munitions dropped by Saudi fighter jets also have been found at sites in Yemen where civilians died in the kingdom’s bombing raids. Asked about those attacks, Resnick said that the U.S. wants to make sure American arms are “used in ways that advance U.S. national security.” She said the U.S. continued to work with partners on trying to prevent civilian killings.

As visitors enter the Dubai Air Show, they first see local Emirati defense firm EDGE showing off a wide variety of its own munitions. Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia in recent years have sought to improve their own arms industries in part to avoid seeing their armament supplies cut off over Western concerns.

Russia similarly has sought to make an impression at the show, flying a new attack helicopter and showing off the Checkmate fighter jet in a music-video-style presentation to journalists on the tarmac. But Resnick dismissed that effort, saying flatly that the Checkmate had “not in the least” ever come up in discussions with the Emiratis.

“We have not seen any strategic competitor be able to fill the kind of role that we play here in the region,” Resnick said.

2,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/11/15/brittle-air-refueling-capability-endangers-us-during-major-war/,defense,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. military’s aerial refueling capability has become “brittle” and aged, placing the nation at risk of being unable to sustain combat against a major adversary, a new report from the Hudson Institute said.

The report, “Resilient Aerial Refueling: Safeguarding the U.S. Military’s Global Reach,” sounds several alarm bells about the military’s tanker fleet and its possibly waning ability to help U.S. forces project power around the globe.

“In 2021, the U.S. aerial refueling enterprise is losing altitude,” said the report, released Monday and written by Timothy Walton and Bryan Clark of the institute’s Center for Defense Concepts and Technology.

Since the end of the Cold War three decades ago, the report said, tankers have continued to fly to support both peaceful deployments and wartime operations around the world. As the military settled into an “expeditionary posture” in which forces were more frequently deployed, the Air Force’s tanker inventory shrunk from 701 aircraft to roughly 473, further increasing stress on the fleet. As this high pace of operations became a new normal for the tankers, the Hudson Institute said, the fleet was left with hardly any headroom to take on new missions — including responding to China or Russia, short of war.

“Without significant changes [the Defense Department] risks fielding air forces unable to conduct complex, distributed operations at scale,” the report said. “During conflict, adversaries may be emboldened to exploit vulnerabilities in both the brittle aerial refueling architecture and U.S. operational plans more broadly. As the strength of the U.S. aerial refueling architecture becomes a weakness, U.S. military forces may be incapable of deterring or defeating aggression.”

Another concerning factor is the advancing age of the military’s tankers — the average tanker is 52 years old — and the declining readiness that could result from an increasingly “geriatric” fleet. Delays in bringing the new KC-46 Pegasus tanker into operation could worsen the situation, as older KC-10 Extender and KC-135 Stratotanker airframes are retired before their successor aircraft and their crews are ready.

Hudson said the military — particularly the Air Force — will need to tackle improvements to its aerial refueling from several angles, not just by adding more tankers. The top priority, according to the authors, should be to significantly build up airfields, bulk fuel storage and distribution, and defenses in the Indo-Pacific region — to the tune of another $633 million per year for the next decade, and $400 million annually afterward. This could boost the military’s tanker capacity in the region by 63% in a decade and roughly double it by 2041, the report said — even if it means the Air Force procures fewer tankers to pay for those improvements.

If the Air Force doesn’t expand its refueling posture on the ground as well as distribute its forces and fuel stores, it could find itself cornered by China in a conflict, the report said. In such a conflict, the tanker fleet could find itself with about a dozen airfields from which to operate that have the necessary runway, ramp space and fuel stores, as well as political access, Hudson said.

This would seriously limit how many aircraft tankers could offer support, and place them at greater risk of attack, the report added.

The Defense Department “should improve the [tanker] architecture’s resilience by evolving today’s brittle posture to a more-distributed one that leverages clusters of mutually supporting military and civil airfields on U.S., allied and partner territory, consistent with the U.S. Air Force’s Agile Combat Employment concept,” the report said.

Further distribution of refueling operations would also help the military better protect its fuel stockpiles and keep access to tankers at sea and over-the-shore fuel delivery systems that the armed forces would need to move fuel in significant quantities, the report said.

For example, the report said, the U.S. military’s use civilian airfields in Japan and South Korea would complicate China’s targeting efforts. Some of those airfields could be used for extended operations, it explained, and others could simply be “drop-in” sites for tankers to quickly gas up and take off again.

The Air Force also needs to keep evolving its aerial refueling fleet, Hudson said, by fielding a new tanker to bridge the gap between the KC-46 and the next generation of aircraft known as the KC-Z. This bridge tanker, known as the KC-Y, could either be Boeing’s KC-46 or Lockheed Martin’s LMXT next-generation tanker, a modified Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport.

Hudson said the bridge tanker must be able to carry out long-range missions and offload large quantities of fuel, since small tankers aren’t enough to meet the Air Force’s requirements. But it warned that the bridge tanker program shouldn’t sap money that would otherwise go to improving tankers already in the fleet, or developing the next-generation KC-Z advanced air refueling tanker.

The Air Force also must speed up development of the KC-Z, the report said; if 18-24 of those aircraft are procured each year, the Air Force could retire KC-135s earlier than expected and lower the overall age of the fleet, which would allow the Air Force to spend more on procurement and less on operations and support.

The report also said that modernizing command, control and communications in aerial refueling would make operations more efficient and effective.

3,https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/dubai-air-show/2021/11/14/thailand-becomes-first-foreign-customer-of-at-6-light-attack-aircraft/,defense,"Correction: A spokesperson for Textron has clarified a company quote that included an erroneous statement regarding the Link 16, which is exported to several nations. This story is updated to remove the inaccurate information.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The Royal Thai Air Force has awarded a $143 million contract to Textron Aviation for eight Beechcraft AT-6 Wolverine aircraft, ground support equipment, spare parts, training and other equipment.

Thailand’s deal with the American company on the first day of the Dubai Airshow makes it the first international customer of the light attack aircraft. Under the contract, work will take place at the company’s Wichita, Kansas, facility.

Thomas Hammoor, president and CEO of Textron Aviation Defense, said in a statement that the Royal Thai Air Force selected the Beechcraft AT-6 to conduct a broad array of missions in support of border security as well as anti-smuggling, counternarcotics and anti-human trafficking operations.

“The RTAF is a key U.S. security ally and operator of one of the most advanced air forces in Asia Pacific. Its extensive market research and stringent procurement process sought the alignment of best cost, schedule, and performance to replace its existing fleet of aging Aero L-39 Albatros aircraft and advance the capabilities of its fleet with the latest technology,” he added.

The contract for the AT-6 — designated the Beechcraft AT-6TH in Thailand — supports the country’s modernization priorities and the mutual defense cooperation agreement between the U.S. and Thailand, a company statement said. The American firm also said the contract contributes to the growth of Thailand’s aerospace industry, as detailed in the 10-year Royal Thai Air Force Purchase and Development (P&D) Plan, and aligns with the country’s so-called S-Curve 11 strategy — a program partly meant to back the domestic defense industry.

The AT-6 is on display at the Dubai Airshow, where its pilot told Defense News that the aircraft flew from the United States to the United Arab Emirates, passing through 11 countries to refuel for a total of 33 flying hours.

“AT-6 will take part in the continued light-attack experiment, which facilitates working with other nations to highlight the interoperability through a capability to network communications — the AERONet,” Fouad Kasri, Textron Aviation Defense’s regional sales vice president for the Middle East and North Africa, told Defense News, referring to the U.S. Air Force-designed data link meant to provide battlefield situational awareness. “Other countries are looking for exporting [the] AeroNet to get a 360-[degree] view of the battlespace, and to increase the interoperability between nations.”

Textron Aviation Defense training of Thai maintenance professionals will begin in Thailand in 2023, according to a company statement, with pilot training to begin in Wichita in 2024. The AT-6 are to join the Royal Thai fleet in 2024, the statement said.

In October 2019, the U.S. State Department gave the green light to Tunisia to enter talks with Textron for its trainer and light-attack aircraft requirements. And in December 2020, Textron Aviation delivered an AT-6 Wolverine to the U.S. Air Force; the second aircraft is expected to arrive next month.

Claiming that the “A400M is safer now,” TAI said in a Nov. 11 statement that the DIRCM was integrated to the A400M with the tail number MSN 105 — a first for the aircraft.

“The new system will detect and destroy incoming missiles via a missile warning unit, and a hand-held air defense systems directed to the A400M aircraft,” TAI said. “With the integration of DIRCM system, the aircraft gained a capability that will enable 360-degree detection of multiple missiles with its multi-target capability.”

Other companies with shares in the aircraft effort at Britain’s BAE Systems, Germany’s EADS and Belgium’s Flabel. The DIRCM effort is TAI’s first design-to-build contribution to the program.

TAI is currently producing 405 detail and subassembly parts for the DIRCM program, in addition to the forward-center fuselage, the tail cone and rear fuselage top panel, flaps/speed brakes, paratrooper and emergency exit doors, lighting systems, the primary design and supply of waste/clean water systems, final assembly line management/support, as well as the design and manufacture of fuselage wiring, excluding the cockpit interior and exterior lighting systems.

5,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2021/11/22/italy-air-force-f-35b-makes-first-time-landing-on-italian-carrier/,defense,"ROME – An Italian Air Force F-35B has landed for the first time on the Cavour, the Italian Navy’s aircraft carrier, joining a Navy F-35B on board and signaling the long awaited start of joint activities between the two forces using the aircraft.

During the exercise on Nov. 21 the two jets flew together from the Cavour to land on the nearby Queen Elizabeth – the Royal Navy carrier currently in the Mediterranean, while two U.S. Marine F-35Bs currently based on the British vessel flew to the Cavour, before U.S., Italian and British B’s flew maneuvers together.

The exercise was officially about F-35Bs from different countries working together, but the big breakthrough was the sight of Italian Navy and Air Force jets flying alongside each other after a slow start to cooperation between the forces.

The Navy now has three of 15 F-35Bs due to be delivered, two of which are training in the United States, while a third was delivered to the Cavour in July.

The Air Force is taking delivery of 60 F-35As, but has also received the first of 15 expected B’s it plans to deploy in missions requiring jets able to fly from short runways.

On Sunday, talk of genuine cooperation came thick and fast as Italian chief of staff Adm. Cavo Dragone suggested that in addition to Air Force pilots now flying their jets off the Cavour, Navy pilots would train to join land-based missions.

“The synergies between the Navy and Air Force in the use of the F-35B from the decks of aircraft carriers will be matched in their use from land, operating together in operational situations without runways suitable for conventional aircraft,” he said.

Describing Sunday as a “historic day”, he added, “This a new season in which we head towards complete integration of the F-35Bs of the Air Force and the Navy which will bring total interoperability in air and naval operations.”

In a statement, the Air Force said, “With this activity we are turning a new page where interoperability and the concept of Joint and Combined synergy between armed forces are concrete facts.”

That adds to talk in this year’s Italian defense budget of a ‘STOVL Joint Force,’ suggesting some sort of integrated Italian F-35B force could evolve.

What remains to be decided is where one shared base for the jets could be established, with the Navy hitherto keen to continue to use its base in Grottaglie in southern Italy it has used for its aging Harrier fleet.

The Air Force, in turn, already has a large F-35 base for its A’s and its B at nearby Amendola and believes it makes sense to group all of Italy’s F-35 jets there."
6,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/11/19/niger-becomes-first-foreign-customer-of-turkeys-hurkus-aircraft/,defense,"MERSIN, Turkey — Niger has become the first foreign customer of the Hurkus trainer aircraft, produced by Turkish Aerospace Industries.

Turkey’s Directorate of Communications said Nov. 19 on its website that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke with his counterpart in Niger, Mohamed Bazoum, by phone about bilateral relations. “President Erdoğan stated that the TB2 drones, Hurkus aircraft, and armored vehicles that Niger would procure from Turkey would strengthen its military and security forces,” according to the directorate’s statement.

Temel Kotil, the head of TAI, first made mention of the Hurkus export during a TV interview on CNN Türk on Nov. 11, but he did not name the customer. Kotil said at the time that the company signed a contract for export, with the first aircraft scheduled for delivery in six months.

Officials have not disclosed the quantity and exact variant associated with the order. However, Kotil said in an April interview that the company was very close to exporting 12 Hurkus-C aircraft.

“The sale of Hurkus marks Turkey’s first military aircraft export that was designed and manufactured entirely with domestic resources,” Kotil said during the Nov. 11 interview.

Mehmet Cem Demirci, a Turkish political and security analyst, told Defense News that the export deal is important for Turkey because it shows the country can develop military aircraft that meet both national needs and foreign standards.

“Turkey has been in the foreground in armed drone exports in the recent years, but now we’re witnessing the sale of a manned aircraft. Furthermore, it is a competitive aircraft that was designed and engineered in Turkey,” Demirci said. “The Erdoğan administration seems to have prioritized African countries in its search for alternate markets. This is the second deal revealed following Erdoğan’s October visits to African states. Turkish Dearsan Shipyard has recently signed a contract with Nigeria to build two offshore patrol vessels.”

The analyst expects the Turkish government or local defense companies will announce more deals with African states in the following months.

The Hurkus is a tandem two-seat, low-wing, single-engine turboprop aircraft that was designed as a new-generation trainer as well as a platform for performing light-attack and armed reconnaissance combat missions.

The Hurkus-C is an armed variant that can be used for close-air support missions. It is fitted with a forward-looking infrared sensor and has a maximum weapons load of 3,300 pounds. It’s able to take off and land on unprepared runways. The main advantage of the Hurkus-C is that it reduces the cost of air power, particularly in low-intensity conflict theaters where anti-air warfare threats are negligible.

The commissioning ceremony at Chiayi Airbase was attended by Taiwan’s president Tsai Ing-wen, who said the F-16 upgrade project showed the firm commitment of the Taiwan-U.S. partnership.

The ceremony saw the inauguration of the first fighter wing of Taiwan’s Republic of China Air Force of ROCAF that have been fully equipped with the upgraded jets, which are designated the F-16V.

Chiayi is the home of the ROCAF’s 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, comprised of the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Tactical Fighter Groups. The 21st Tactical Fighter Group is the unit that has fully converted to the F-16V, with the ROCAF saying the service has 64 upgraded fighters already in its inventory.

This is out of a force of 141 F-16s, which are the survivors of 150 aircraft delivered in the late 1990s comprised of a mix of F-16A single-seat and F-16B twin-seat Block 20 aircraft.

The upgrade, known as the Phoenix Rising program, includes the installation of Northrop Grumman’s AN/APG-83 scalable agile beam radar, a new mission computer and upgraded electronic warfare equipment like the Terma AN/ALQ-213 Electronic Warfare Management systems.

Other upgraded systems include the Rockwell Collins-Elbit Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System, which allows off-boresight targeting of adversary aircraft during air combat, and a newer identification friend-or-foe system.

Taiwan’s F-16 upgrade program is expected to cost $3.96 billion and will continue until 2023.

In addition to the upgrade program, the island is also buying another 66 new-build F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft from the United States to replace its obsolete fleet of Northrop F-5E/F Tiger II interceptors.

Taiwan is scrambling to improve its defense in the face of China’s increasing determination to take back the self-ruling island, which China sees as a breakaway province.

China has repeatedly said it would prefer to reintegrate Taiwan into the mainland peacefully, but has refused to rule out the use of force. Modern Taiwan was founded in 1949 when remnants of Chinese nationalist forces fled to the island following defeat in the Chinese Civil War."

The aircrafts’ delivery also marked the 49th and 50th KC-46 to be delivered to the Air Force, Boeing spokesman Jerry Drelling said in an email.

McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst is expected to receive 15 more KC-46s in fiscal 2022, and another nine in fiscal 2023, the Air Force said in its release.

The 305th and 514th Air Mobility Wings at McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst will operate and maintain the tankers, the base said in a release, and the 87th Air Base Wing will also provide installation support. The 514th is a Reserve wing.

“We are extremely excited to welcome the KC-46 to the joint base, where it will add to an already rich heritage of delivering hope and answering the call,” 305th commander Col. Scott Wiederholt said at a ceremony for the tankers’ arrival. “The Pegasus will get the job done.”

The Air Force has been steadily expanding the Pegasus’ capabilities this year. Last month, the service announced it had approved the KC-46 to use its boom to refuel fourth-generation F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets during missions for U.S. Transportation Command.

That approval allows the Pegasus to support 62% of aircraft that need air refueling support from TRANSCOM, and allows the KC-46 to take on more missions that otherwise would have been handled by the older KC-135 Stratotanker and KC-10 Extender.

In August, the Air Force approved the Pegasus to refuel the B-52 Stratofortress, C-17 Globemaster and other KC-46s with its boom. And in July, the aircraft’s first interim capability release decision gave it approval to refuel aircraft with its centerline drogue system. Additional capability expansions are expected in the future.

The KC-46 is also stationed at Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma, McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina and Pease Air National Guard Base in New Hampshire.

9,https://www.defensenews.com/smr/cybercon/2021/11/10/the-cyber-battlefield-against-china-and-russia-is-constantly-shifting-heres-how-the-nsa-is-trying-to-stay-on-top/,defense,"WASHINGTON — In the battle over cyberspace, adversaries to the United States are continually switching up their methods to hack U.S. systems, a senior National Security Agency official said Wednesday.

That means the U.S. must in turn keep shifting the tools and techniques it uses to counter hackers from nations like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea — and team up with the private sector to do so, David Luber, deputy director for NSA’s cybersecurity directorate, said in a panel during C4ISRNET’s CyberCon.

“Even as we’re on this call right now, the cyberspace domain is changing,” Luber said. “New malware is being released, new vulnerabilities are being discovered, and adversaries will use those vulnerabilities to gain access to our critical … Department of Defense and national security systems.”

As part of its effort to work with the private sector, Luber said NSA’s Cybersecurity Collaboration Center is developing analytics that help it sift through both government signals intelligence collected overseas and what industry analysts have spotted.

“By comparing results, we’re able to better understand the tradecraft of those adversaries, and then develop, jointly, methods to thwart their activities,” Luber said.

The NSA has published more than 50 cybersecurity advisories over the last two years to share threat intelligence with the defense industry and other organizations. Some of those advisories have gone so far as to highlight specific pieces of malware, or tactics, techniques and procedures that Russian or Chinese hackers use to try to get into sensitive networks and infrastructures, and common vulnerabilities they like to exploit.

Hackers from Iran, North Korea or non-state organizations that try to extort money using ransomware are also threats, Luber said.

Rear Adm. Mike Ryan, head of the Coast Guard’s Cyber Command, said during the same panel that while the competition to recruit in-demand cybersecurity professionals is tough, his service’s mission and the enthusiasm it breeds help make it competitive.

“People want to be part of my command,” Ryan said. “I am not going to win on the salary and compensation schemes, but I can definitely be competitive through the selfless service we enjoy from … the incredible opportunities that we allow our people to execute.”

But money never hurts — Ryan noted the Coast Guard is trying to use bonuses to attract talented candidates.

Luber said NSA has partnerships with 340 universities nationwide to encourage students to study cybersecurity. Every summer, he said, about 300 students receive 12-week internships at NSA, and 70% to 85% of those interns go on to work for NSA full-time after graduation.

NSA also is trying to encourage even younger people to consider careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics through a program called GenCyber, which offers students from kindergarten through high school opportunities to attend summer camps focused on cybersecurity. This past summer, he said, GenCyber offered 146 camps in 46 states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico.

“It begins early with partnerships — partnerships at K through 12, partnerships with universities, the professors, the students and the faculty — to build the next generation of cybersecurity experts to bring their talents to the National Security Agency,” Luber said.

10,https://www.defensenews.com/training-sim/2021/11/10/singapore-tries-to-normalize-military-training-schedule-after-pandemic-disruption/,defense,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Singapore has stepped up its overseas training exercises over the past two months as the land-scarce Southeast Asian nation looks to resume its normal military training cycle that was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

This includes an integrated sense-and-strike exercise involving the Army and the Republic of Singapore Air Force in the U.S. state of Idaho, which ran Sept. 14-25 and saw the debut of an improved artificial intelligence-enabled command-and-control system.

The Singaporean military also carried out a six-week, tri-service exercise in a training area on Australia’s eastern seaboard, while Air Force jets conducted air combat training at a dedicated range in northern Australia.

Closer to home, the island nation hosted ships and aircraft from Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom for a multinational exercise in the waters and airspace off Malaysia as the five countries marked the 50th anniversary of Five Power Defence Arrangements pact.

What happened in Idaho?

The exercise in Idaho, code-named Forging Sabre, involved 200 personnel from Singapore’s Army and another 600 from its Air Force. The drill took place at Mountain Home Air Force Base, which is home to a mixed American-Singaporean training squadron flying Singaporean Boeing F-15SG Eagle multirole fighters.

Singapore debuted the improved Command and Control Information System, which is under development by its Defence Science and Technology Agency. The C2 platform can recommend to its operator what it believes is the best means by which to carry out a strike against a target. The system makes it recommendation based on factors such as mission success, impact on other missions, survivability of assets, timeliness and resource effectiveness, while laying out various consequences and considerations.

It is still a man-in-the-loop system, however, with the operator or a commander making the final decision on whether to accept the recommendation.

The exercise also involved Lockheed Martin M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, F-16C/D Fighting Falcon jets and Boeing AH-64D Apache helicopters. The aircraft came from Singaporean training detachments based in Arizona.

Meanwhile, in Australia ...

On the other side of the world, Republic of Singapore Air Force F-15 and F-16 fighter jets deployed from Singapore to Darwin, Australia, in early October. Together with a Gulfstream G550 airborne early warning aircraft, the jets dropped live and inert guided and unguided bombs, and they conducted air combat training at the Delamere Air Weapons Range.

Further east, the service’s newly delivered CH-47F Chinook helicopters assigned to the Oakey training detachment in Australia supported Exercise Wallaby, an integrated tri-service exercise that saw 580 Singaporean personnel take part.

The exercise, held at Australia’s Shoalwater Bay training area, saw the CH-47Fs carry out troop lift and transport operations, as well as amphibious assault exercises operating from a Republic of Singapore Navy landing ship.

Singapore’s small landmass of some 280 square miles, as well as its congested airspace and confined waters, mean much of its military training is conducted overseas.

In addition to deploying its forces to train in Australia and Guam, it also has several aircraft detachments permanently based in Australia, France and the United States, although its overseas training deployments have been severely curtailed due to pandemic-related travel restrictions."
11,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2021/11/09/spains-ministry-of-defense-denies-interest-in-the-f-35/,defense,"WASHINGTON — Spain has no interest in the American F-35 fighter jet and is solely committed to the Future Combat Air System that it is pursuing with France and Germany, a defense spokeswoman told Reuters.

The statement comes after Spanish officials at a defense exhibition in Madrid last week said the Lockheed Martin-made plane was a least a theoretical contender for the Spanish Navy and, if the sea service were to select it, the Air Force.

“The Spanish government has no budget to enter into any other jet project in addition to the one that is already in place. We rule out entering the F-35 project. Our investment commitment is in the FCAS,” Reuters quoted a defense ministry spokeswoman as saying in a Nov. 9 report.

Rejection of the F-35 comes after speculation on social media the country was actively looking into a purchase, based on a separate report in the London-based Janes defense publication last week. That article cited information about a Lockheed Martin F-35 sales campaign in Europe, including in Spain, as coming from “an official,” with no affiliation given.

The case of the prospective F-35 sale to Madrid was particularly sensitive, as Spain is working to establish itself as an equal partner with Germany and France in the FCAS program. Giving the impression of flirting with the American product at the same time would have undercut Madrid’s aspirations toward that end.

And amid a decline in aerospace sector revenues caused by the coronavirus pandemic, organizers hope the event will contribute to the industry’s recovery and shape its future.

The United Arab Emirates-based conference is organized by Tarsus F&E LLC Middle East and is expected to host more that 20 country pavilions, 160 aircraft displays and over 1,200 exhibitors.

“The event will support the UAE’s ‘Make It In The Emirates’ initiative, showcasing the services provided by UAE entities to global experts and in the industry, and encouraging collaboration between different parties,” the organizers told Defense News, referring to the national economic initiative aimed at boosting local production.

In coordination with the Defense Services Marketing Council, the 17th Dubai Airshow will also feature a new advisory board that will assist with the actual event but also try to address challenges facing regional sectors. The board consists of high-level industry, government and academic members.

Who’s attending, and what’s planned?

For the first time, Israel, the Czech Republic, Australia and Belgium each booked a pavilion. Israel’s participation comes after the country and some of its neighbors signed the Abraham Accords, aimed at improving diplomatic relations. Also new this year is the participation of Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems; Singapore’s Kelley Aerospace; American companies Accenture and M4 Engineering; Europe-based business Eurosam; and Emirati companies NAFFCO and G42.

Other exhibitors expected to attend include American firms Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies; France’s Airbus and Dassault; Emirati firm Mubadala; and Brazil’s Embraer.

UAE defense conglomerate Edge is the show’s technology partner.

The organizers said this edition will introduce the brand-new conference stage TechXplore, which will show how technology is helping reboot aviation and changing the entire flying experience. “As part of the conference, the aviation industry’s leading tech minds will discuss the role of 5G, AI and machine learning, cybersecurity, and automation technologies in the development of the industry,” they explained.

New forums this year will focus on trending aerospace topics like advanced aerial mobility, sustainability, as well as space and air traffic and cargo.

Another new feature is the dedicated startup event VISTA, co-hosted by Boeing and AE Industrial Partners through their investment in the HorizonX venture capital scheme. Show organizers described VISTA in a statement as “the ultimate platform for innovators, creators and market disruptors to display the latest technologies and play a part in accelerating the future of the aerospace and defence industries.”

Product pitching competitions during VISTA will be held in partnership with government and industry stakeholders including Etihad Airways, the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre, Amazon Web Services and Boeing’s applied innovation team.

“The competition will provide startups with a chance to pitch solutions that support the host partners’ initiatives in a bid to compete for exclusive prizes. VISTA will also serve as a platform that provides mentorship programs, workshops, and high-level networking, learn about market trends and receive the best guidance from experts, key decision makers, and global investors,” organizers wrote in the statement.

Staying safe

From Jan. 3, 2020, to Oct. 25, 2021, there were 739,284 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 2,130 deaths in the UAE, according to the World Heath Organization. As of Oct. 25, 2021, a total of 20,921,016 vaccine doses were administered in the country.

“To ensure the utmost safety and well-being of all our attendees, we will be placing strict measures like keeping social distance, wearing of masks, thermal screening and sanitization, having a maximum capacity at exhibition stands, and more. The show will have trained safety wardens monitoring social distancing and wearing of masks throughout the event at all times,” organizers told Defense News.

“Some technologies that have been widely used in the aviation space post COVID-19 include contactless solutions like facial recognition, thermal screening and autonomous cleaning robots.”

Additional measures for security and comfort include “wearable technology, robotics used in helping with customer management and baggage handling, and 5G ... to deliver higher network speed and accommodate the requirements of passengers. Other emerging technologies include AI use in chatbots and cybersecurity that uses advanced technologies like blockchain to combat cyberattacks.”

13,https://www.defensenews.com/industry/techwatch/2021/11/08/darpa-has-caught-a-gremlin-drone-in-midair-can-it-grab-four-in-a-half-hour/,defense,"WASHINGTON — The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Dynetics proved they can catch an X-61A Gremlin drone in flight and bring it aboard a C-130A mothership. But the next step will be more difficult.

In a conference call with reporters Monday, Dynetics’ Gremlins program manager Tim Keeter said the program now must prove it can recover multiple drones repeatedly, reliably and quickly enough for real-world operations.

For DARPA, Keeter said, making the American program work at an “operationally relevant rate” would mean being able to recover four drones within a half-hour. He called last month’s successful test — the Gremlins’ fourth such deployment — a milestone for both the program and unmanned aviation, adding that the effort could “dramatically expand” the military’s ability to carry out distributed airborne operations.

He also expressed confidence that with the program over “the biggest hump” of proving airborne recovery can work, it will be able to reach its goal.

“Now we feel the momentum and the wind in our sails, and we’re ready to get this thing moving towards an initial operational capability,” Keeter said.

If the program works as intended, he added, it could one day allow the military to deploy “swarms” of drones into denied areas. That way, the mothership could stay out of harm’s way while the drones gather intelligence, conduct targeting or perform other functions with their sensors in dangerous airspace. The drones also could be deployed early in a conflict to overwhelm an adversary with numbers, he noted.

And eventually, Keeter said, the military could use artificial intelligence to allow these drones to behave autonomously, albeit with minimal supervision. However, the Gremlins program is not directly using AI right now for its flight demonstrations.

“What that might look like in a larger-scale conflict would be multiple sensors working together and fusing, that the Gremlins would carry into a contested environment, where right now even one operator could control up to four of those,” Keeter said.

If one Gremlin in the swarm is shot down, Keeter added, the rest of the drones could adjust for its loss and still carry out the mission.

Late last year, DARPA carried out a series of flight tests in which nine attempts were made to recover three Gremlins, none of which were successful due to greater-than-expected turbulence that kept the drones from locking into the docking station. After those tests, Keeter said, the program analyzed the data to identify ways to lessen the turbulence that stymied those recovery attempts.

Brandon Hiller, Dynetics’ chief engineer for the Gremlins program, said the program saw several key improvements put in place since the late 2020 test to make it possible to catch the drone in the docking bullet, shut down drone operations and reel it in. The finetuning was almost entirely in the program’s software, he said.

More work remains until the Gremlin program meets DARPA’s goal of four recoveries in 30 minutes, Hiller said — but the program thinks it has a path forward.

“We’re not there yet,” Hiller said. “But … we know what needs to change in the system, both from a hardware and a software perspective, to get us to that point.”

Keeter thinks the program will be able to carry out the quick recovery of multiple Gremlins during their next deployment, though he could not say when that might take place.

After that, the program will soon move onto its next phase, which will demonstrate how the drones would perform on a mission. That would mean “putting it together with payloads and single operators controlling multiple vehicles in a live-virtual-constructive environment, performing different aspects of the missions [to] showcase what this capability could really do and how it could help transform our military,” Keeter said.

Additionally, the Gremlins recovery system can be adapted to other aircraft, meaning the program won’t always need to use the C-130A as its mothership, Keeter said.

The first successful airborne Gremlin recovery took place Oct. 29 at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. It was the third flight in that test. The first Gremlin that took flight that day had a power problem that developed quickly, and the drone was lost before its parachute recovery system could fully deploy. The cause of that Gremlin’s loss was first reported by Breaking Defense.

Keeter called the loss of that Gremlin “a great disappointment,” but one that was part of the learning process. The team saw that either an anomaly or equipment issue caused it to go wrong, and team members switched to a different configuration to avoid that problem in the other flights. He declined to go into further detail without DARPA’s approval.

“When you have a system with this many complexities and things interacting together, you come prepared for lots of options to fly with,” Keeter said. “Certain options may put you in areas where you’re more likely to encounter other issues.”

The second drone that flew in the test was not recovered in midair, instead parachuting to the ground.

The third drone was the one that was recovered and was turned around for a second flight within 24 working hours. However that drone’s second flight was not recovered in midair, and it too landed on the ground “fairly softly” with the help of its parachute, Keeter said.

14,https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/dubai-air-show/2021/11/08/abu-dhabis-dilemma-will-the-uae-ever-operate-the-f-35/,defense,"BEIRUT — Talks over technology agreements. Debates about system integration. Concerns over cooperation with China and Russia.

These are some of the pressure points involved in negotiations between the United Arab Emirates and the United States as the former seeks a fleet of F-35 aircraft. But buying what is arguably the most advanced fighter jet involves more than a simple commercial transaction; it’s like “renewing the marriage vows” between Abu Dhabi and Washington, said Danny Sebright, president of the U.S.-UAE Business Council.

That has put the UAE at a crossroads: renew its military vows with the U.S. or turn eastward toward Russia and China.

“Our two military forces interoperate today in joint operations because they share common equipment and training,” Sebright told Defense News. “If this sale goes forward, the UAE will be making a new commitment in defense and military force cooperation with the U.S. for the future. By definition this will mean that the UAE and the U.S. will have agreed to renew their commitment to each other as strategic partners, and any cooperation or influence from Russia and China will be greatly diminished.”

West vs. East

The Biden administration has pressured the UAE to remove Chinese firm Huawei from its telecommunications network, with some fearing this could be an ultimatum where the F-35 deal hangs in the balance. Huawei entered the limelight during the Trump administration, with the federal government alleging the firm’s association with Beijing represents a security and espionage threat.

“Based on my information, the F-35/Reaper program is still stuck,” said Corrado Cok, a defense expert at Gulf State Analytics, referring to a $23 billion arms package approved in the waning days of the Trump administration that included 50 F-35s, 18 MQ–9B Reaper drones, as well as thousands of munitions and hundreds of missiles. “The UAE remains unwilling to bow to Washington’s requests on the scaling down of its relations with China, especially over the issue of Huawei, which the U.S. has set de facto as a precondition for the deal.”

In 2016, Huawei and UAE-based telecommunications service provider “du” launched the world’s first commercial transport software-defined network on the host network to make the UAE’s traditional network more efficient. Three years later, the UAE’s Telecommunications Regulatory Authority asked the tech giant to open a “5G & IoT Joint OpenLab” in Dubai.

Anthony Cordesman, who holds the emeritus chair in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, isn’t convinced Huawei networks in the UAE could threaten the F-35′s security.

“Secure military communications have nothing to do with commercial communication. Huawei is an internet-linked firm, and it is not linked to many aspects of military operations or communications. They are probably completely different structures,” Cordesman said.

He acknowledged concerns that some Chinese systems could allow the government to read digital communications at the civil level, but stressed this isn’t something that should concern armed forces.

For its part, Russia has pitched an alternative to the American-made aircraft. Russian defense company Rostec and the UAE’s Defence Ministry launched in 2017 a joint venture to co-produce fifth-generation Sukhoi jets, which eventually gave birth to a potentially cheaper aircraft known as the Su-75.

“Yet, with the F-35 deal approved, the Su-75 venture would be set aside and any other Russian-Emirati program on air defense systems would be blocked by U.S. veto,” Cok said. “If finalized, the deal will limit the areas of cooperation with Russia and China because of the strings that the U.S. will most likely attach to it.”

Furthermore, explained Bilal Saab, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, interoperability with U.S. forces would suffer should the UAE choose a Chinese or Russian aircraft.

Where do negotiations stand?

The deal made with the Trump administration for the aircraft was put on hold after President Joe Biden took office. A spokesperson with the U.S. State Department said the new administration will continue processing the contract, but the deal specifics would undergo reviews and consultation with Emirati officials.

If the F-35 shows up at the Dubai Airshow, scheduled for Nov. 14-18, “this will be a strong signal that the negotiations are moving forward in a very positive direction,” Sebright said, noting he doesn’t expect a “breakthrough announcement” at the event.

“Both governments are involved in intense negotiations regarding the specifics of various aspects of the possible joint program. There are still many steps to go, since it is a very complex sale. The F-35 is the most sophisticated fighter in the U.S. arsenal and it is a gamechanger in military capability for any country that becomes a partner in the program,” he said.

Still under discussion are costs, levels of technological and operational capabilities, the provision of sensors and weapons systems integrated on any future Emirati F-35 fleet, and domestic industrial participation in the program. “Finally, with every country there is always a very sensitive policy discussion about ... how the weapons system might be deployed. These provisos or agreed understandings on how the F-35 can be used can also take quite some time to conclude,” he added.

Cok noted the UAE has a network of lobbyists in Washington pushing for a final sale, specifically pointing to Tom Barrack. The chair of Trump’s 2017 inaugural committee recently pleaded not guilty to charges he secretly lobbied the U.S. on behalf of the UAE.

F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin declined to comment on the potential deal.

15,https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/feindef/2021/11/08/airbus-unveils-jet-trainer-with-eyes-on-spain/,defense,"MADRID — By the end of this decade, the Spanish Air Force will replace its half-century-old fighter trainers with data-centric aircraft to train its pilots to fly fifth- and sixth-generation jets. And even though a contract isn’t yet on the horizon, Airbus is ready to start building.

The aerospace company’s Spanish subsidiary presented its Advanced Fighter Jet Trainer concept last week during the biennial FEINDEF conference in Madrid, Spain. If selected, the AFJT would replace the Spanish Air Force’s Northrop F-5M and CASA C-101 Aviojet aircraft, which prepare airmen to fly EF-18A Hornets and Eurofighter Typhoons.

The AFJT is a clean-sheet design based on the Spanish Air Force’s operational requirements, Abel Nin, the company’s program lead, told Defense News on the sidelines of FEINDEF on Friday.

Currently, the aircraft is designed to measure about 46 feet from nose to tail, with a nearly 33-foot wingspan. The metal airframe will be damage-tolerant, resistant to corrosion and easy to repair, per Airbus.

Nin expects a prototype could fly four years after the program is formally launched. While the Air Force plans to buy at least 20 Eurofighter Typhoons to replace its oldest EF-18As, it may opt to buy more Typhoons or Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to replace its full Hornet fleet.

The AFJT will be capable of training pilots to fly EF-18As, Typhoons, F-35s and the Future Combat Air System’s sixth-generation fighter jet, Nin said.

The proposed integrated trainer system will feature live-virtual-constructive technology, and Indra is partnering with Airbus to develop simulators, Nin said.

While Madrid is Airbus’ main prospective customer, the AFJT could serve other countries. Representatives from the Mexican Air Force attended Friday’s panel discussion at FEINDEF, and company officials previously highlighted France and Finland as possible customers.

“The main purpose here is to initiate the project,” Nin said.

The Spanish Air Force submitted the operational requirements document for a new jet trainer in 2020, said Lt. Col. Jesus Gutierrez Gallego, who works with the service’s program planning division. The service doesn’t recommend a specific vendor, and now it’s up to the Defence Ministry to deliberate and decide whether Airbus will receive the contract, he told Defense News.

“We need it before the current system starts its sundown,” he said.

Air Force officials said the F-5M is expected to begin retiring from service between 2027 and 2030.

Ministry officials at the conference could not say when a decision on the trainer jet contract might be made, nor did they say whether any other companies submitted proposals for the F-5M replacement.

The F-5M has been in service for more than 50 years, said Lt. Col. Miguel Angel Marazuela Martinez, chief of the service’s 23rd Instruction and Attack Wing at Talavera la Real Air Base.

“The [training] system that we have currently is quite solid, and it’s been evolving for many, many years, but we have to help it out,” he said during the panel. “And we are going to do it with this new plane.”

The service is also investing in advanced technologies, including biometrics, artificial intelligence and data fusion, to more accurately train its pilots, Marazuela Martinez said.

Helmets equipped with cutting-edge sensors and biometric watches will help instructors define “what is the best learning curve of every single student in a personalized way,” he added.

Even the end of the Afghanistan War isn’t likely to mean a major drawdown from the region.

While the Air Force has adjusted its posture — for example, bringing home its EC-130H Compass Call electronic warfare planes for the first time in 20 years — retired Gen. Herbert “Hawk” Carlisle does not expect a radical rebalancing of air power assets in the Middle East.

“It will change, but … it may not be as draconian or as significant as some people may think,” Carlisle, the former head of Air Combat Command who is now chief executive of the National Defense Industrial Association, said in an Oct. 21 interview with Defense News.

U.S. Air Forces Central Command did not respond to questions by press time.

John Venable, a former Air Force fighter pilot and defense policy expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he suspects the U.S. will pull back some other strategic platforms — such as the RC-135 Rivet Joint reconnaissance airplanes — and only moved back in response to an emerging threat.

Many regional challenges remain that will keep the Air Force from making drastic changes, Carlisle said. Some mission sets might change, he explained, but the chances of fighter, tanker or mobility aircraft units coming home from air bases like Incirlik in Turkey or Al Dhafra in the United Arab Emirates are slim.

Indeed, the Air Force probably isn’t done with Afghanistan. Militant organizations such as the Islamic State group’s local branch, ISIS-Khorasan, and al-Qaida are still present there. The Biden administration has repeatedly stressed it plans to conduct so-called over-the-horizon airstrikes if terrorists pose a threat to the U.S., which will require a continued Air Force presence — including fighters or bombers to carry out strikes; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft; drones; and other support aircraft and functions such as tankers.

RELATED

Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall and Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown said in September that over-the-horizon strikes would not look considerably different than previous airstrikes in the region, although U.S. Air Forces Central chief Lt. Gen. Gregory Guillot was still ironing out the details.

“We’ve been doing over-the-horizon support [of] counterterrorism operations for a long time,” Kendall said at the Air Force Association’s annual conference. “It’s a question of scale, as much as anything at this point.”

Carlisle said the military must figure out exactly what it wants from over-the-horizon missions. Would they be used to observe terrorist training camps using ISR aircraft and then, if necessary, calling in an airstrike? Or would that capability be used to bomb a “single bad actor terrorist,” he wondered? And how would this work when the U.S. doesn’t recognize Afghanistan’s Taliban-run government?

Tension with Iran also remains high, which Carlisle said will further require the Air Force to remain locally. The Pentagon has alleged Iran is backing, among others, the militia groups Kata’ib Hezbollah and Kata’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada in Syria, and said they carried out drone attacks against American personnel and facilities in Iraq. The U.S. has twice this year carried out airstrikes along the Iraq-Syria border against the groups and their facilities.

RELATED

The U.S. also wants to keep open the Strait of Hormuz, the only way for ships to exit the Arabian Gulf to open seas. Iran has periodically threatened to block the vital conduit for oil shipments and other commerce.

For “the land component [of the military], leaving Afghanistan had a pretty large impact,” Carlisle said. “I think that naval, air and space components are going to still find a big demand signal coming from that part of the world.”

But losing air bases in Afghanistan — most notably Bagram Airfield near Kabul and Kandahar Airfield in the nation’s southern region — limits America’s ability to conduct counterterrorism operations in the region.

Other local bases have the capacity and flexibility to absorb operations that once operated out of Afghanistan, Carlisle said, but U.S. pilots will have to fly farther, which harms response times and requires additional support from tankers.

“Speed, range and payload are going to be a factor,” Carlisle said. “I know the Air Force is looking hard at this.”

Remotely piloted aircraft have been particularly useful in the region over the last two decades, Carlisle said, and that will likely continue — particularly toward keeping an eye on Iran.

Venable said he expects drones to come in handy for over-the-horizon efforts related to targets in Afghanistan, particularly because flying manned aircraft over that nation has become considerably more risky since the Taliban’s takeover. If an aircrew goes down in the Taliban-controlled nation, a combat search-and-rescue team would have to extract them before they are captured. Such a team taking off from the Gulf would face long flight times, require midair refueling and need to negotiate with Pakistan for a safe air route, among and other complications.

But a drone crashing in Afghanistan is simply a loss of hardware, Venable said.

To support its drone capabilities, the U.S. might seek a deal with a nation bordering Afghanistan to allow clandestine UAV bases, Venable said. But given Russian influence in the region, the Taliban’s strength and the way in which the U.S. left Afghanistan, that might be difficult, he added, even with a friendly nation like Uzbekistan.

“Uzbekistan [doesn’t] want regional trouble,” Venable said. “And after the United States pulled the plug on Afghanistan and left all of our allies in the lurch, why would they bet on us? For now, I think they’re going to sit back and wait for things to settle down before they’ll allow us to operate — clandestinely or officially — out of their country.”

That will mean flying drones or manned aircraft to Afghanistan out of Al Dhafra and Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, he said. But again, that means flying around Iran and through Pakistani airspace — known to pilots as the boulevard.

“The trip itself ... is not too arduous, it’s just a long flight,” Venable said.

While the U.S. might shift its posture in the region, Carlisle said, American allies and partners there should expect a continued American role.

“I think there was a mistaken belief that we’re out of Afghanistan so we’re out of the Middle East,” Carlisle said. “There couldn’t be anything further from the truth.”

17,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/11/05/lockheed-wins-109b-contract-to-modernize-f-22/,defense,"WASHINGTON — The Air Force on Friday awarded Lockheed Martin a $10.9 billion contract to modernize its F-22 Raptor fighter jet.

The massive indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity deal for the F-22 Program Office’s Advanced Raptor Enhancement and Sustainment, or ARES, program will cover up to a decade’s worth of sustainment and modernization of the fifth-generation fighter.

According to a Defense Department announcement, the contract will cover services including upgrades, enhancements and fixes to the Raptor. Lockheed will also provide logistics services and modernization hardware kit procurement.

If all contract options are exercised, the Pentagon expects the work to be finished by Oct. 31, 2031. Work on the contract will be carried out in Fort Worth, Texas.

The contract was a sole-source award to Lockheed Martin, which built the F-22.

However, by the time the F-22′s modernization under ARES is finished, the aircraft could be nearing the end of its life span.

Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles “CQ” Brown said in May the Air Force plans to eventually retire the F-22 as part of an effort to trim its fighter inventory.

Lt. Gen. Clinton Hinote, Air Force deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said in a May interview with Defense News the service is planning to use the Raptor as a “bridge” until the Next Generation Air Dominance program is up and running.

Hinote noted that by the 2030s, the Raptor would be four decades old, having first gone into development in 1991.

“It’s just not going to be the right tool for the job, especially when we’re talking about defending our friends like Taiwan and Japan and the Philippines against a Chinese threat that grows and grows,” Hinote said in May.

18,https://www.defensenews.com/unmanned/2021/11/05/darpa-nabs-gremlin-drone-in-midair-for-first-time/,defense,"Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified the number of Gremlin drones involved in the test flight. Three of the systems flew during the event.

WASHINGTON — For the first time, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency recovered an unmanned X-61 Gremlin air vehicle to a C-130 in flight, marking a milestone in the U.S. military’s effort to deploy swarms of drones from a mothership.

The first successful midair Gremlin recovery took place Oct. 29 at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, DARPA said in a Friday release. During this flight test — the fourth deployment of the Gremlins — two of the small drones successfully carried out all formation flying positions and safety features before one was successfully recovered, DARPA said.

A third Gremlin was destroyed during the flight tests, DARPA said.

The Gremlins team then refurbished the recovered drone and flew it again within 24 working hours, the release said.

DARPA hopes the program — named for the imaginary, mischievous creatures that World War II-era pilots blamed when their aircraft or equipment malfunctioned — will one day allow the military to launch groups of small sensor-laden drones from bombers, cargo planes or smaller aircraft such as fighters.

DARPA envisions the motherships will stay out of range of enemy defenses, but the drone swarms would fly into danger and conduct missions such as intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance or electronic warfare.

After the mothership collects the drones and brings them back to base, ground crews would get them ready for another flight within 24 hours, DARPA said in a 2018 report.

The agency hopes each drone would have a lifetime of 20 flights. The agency said flying these relatively disposable drones would allow the military to accomplish missions much more cheaply and with less maintenance efforts than relying on nonexpendable systems meant to fly for decades.

“This recovery was the culmination of years of hard work and demonstrates the feasibility of safe, reliable airborne recovery,” Lt. Col. Paul Calhoun, the Gremlins program manager in DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office, said in the release. “Such a capability will likely prove to be critical for future distributed air operations.”

Previous attempts to conduct airborne retrievals of the Gremlins were unsuccessful. In October 2020, DARPA kicked off a series of flight tests in which it tried, but failed, nine times to recover three Gremlins. DARPA said at the time those attempts were each inches away from working, and all Gremlins safely parachuted to the ground.

DARPA released a video of the successful recovery that showed the Gremlin latching into a docking bullet that extended from the C-130, folding its wings into its body and then being gripped by a recovery arm that took it into the C-130.

This time, four flights were conducted, during which hours of data — including information on air vehicle performance, how contact worked during the airborne retrieval, and the aerodynamic interactions between the Gremlin and the C-130′s recovery bullet — were collected, the release said.

“Airborne recovery is complex,” Calhoun said in the release. “We will take some time to enjoy the success of this deployment, then get back to work further analyzing the data and determining next steps for the Gremlins technology.”

The Gremlin drones are made by Dynetics, a subsidiary of Leidos.

19,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/11/04/washington-oks-missiles-worth-650m-for-saudis/,defense,"WASHINGTON ― The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale to Saudi Arabia of 280 AIM-120C air-to-air missiles in a deal valued at up to $650 million, the Pentagon said on Thursday.

Riyadh requested to buy 280 AIM-120C-7/C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and 596 LAU-128 Missile Rail Launchers. The package would also include spare parts, support and logistical services. The principal contractor will be Raytheon Technologies, of Waltham, Mass.

The sale is the Biden administration’s first since it announced in February it had paused indefinitely two precision guided munition sales to Saudi Arabia, worth as much as $760 million, as part of a new policy aimed at curtailing violence in Yemen.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson said Thursday the proposed sales were being advanced as Saudi Arabia has seen an increase in cross-border attacks from Iranian-backed Houthi fighters over the past year. The weapons would support Saudi Arabia’s Eurofighter Typhoon, F-15C/D, F-15S and F-I5SA.

The spokesperson said the missile has been used to target drones that have threatened U.S. troops and Saudi civilians, but “is not used to engage ground targets.”

The sale “is fully consistent with the administration’s pledge to lead with diplomacy to end the conflict in Yemen while also ensuring Saudi Arabia has the means to defend itself from Iranian-backed Houthi air attacks,” the spokesperson said.

The Defense Security Cooperation Agency has notified Congress of the sale. However, notifications do not indicate sales are final; if Congress does not reject the potential sale, it goes into negotiations, which determine final quantities of equipment and price.

20,https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/feindef/2021/11/04/f-35-eurofighter-typhoon-are-the-two-options-to-replace-spains-aging-hornets/,defense,"MADRID — Spain has two aircraft in mind to replace over 70 EF-18A fighter jets, and while the program has yet to formally begin, the informal competition between the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Lockheed Martin F-35 is just getting hotter.

Madrid is running two separate efforts to replace its aging Hornets, with the first and more immediate effort involving its 20 oldest platforms, currently based in the Canary Islands.

While the contract has yet to be signed, the service expects to substitute those aircraft on a 1-1 basis with Eurofighter Typhoon multirole jets, said Col. Jesus Ferrer, chief of coordination for fixed-wing systems for Spain’s military procurement office.

The second program aims to replace the wider F-18 fleet, operating out of the air force’s Zaragoza and Torrejón air bases. Lockheed Martin’s F-35 is being considered for this program along with more Eurofighters, Ferrer told Defense News Thursday on the sidelines of the biennial FEINDEF conference in Madrid.

“Those are the two options,” he asserted.

Reports have swirled in recent months surrounding Lockheed Martin’s European ambitions for the Joint Strike Fighter program. Eight countries on the continent are either committed to or already operating F-35s, with Switzerland becoming the latest prospective buyer in June. A highly anticipated fighter jet program in Finland and opportunities on the horizon for the Czech Republic and Greece, as well as Spain, are only stoking the flames more.

But it’s still early days for Madrid’s program. The air force submitted a report with their operational requirements for a new fighter jet this past summer, an official told Defense News on the conference floor. Now, the ministry of defense is weighing the requirements against the potential replacement aircraft.

The wider F-18 fleet is scheduled to remain in service until at least 2030, and Spain’s procurement office is just beginning the aircraft feasibility studies, Ferrer said.

It may come down to one major factor: Whether the Navy opts to buy about a dozen F-35B vertical-takeoff-and-landing (VTOL) aircraft. “If they get the F-35, one option for the Spanish air force will be to purchase the F-35, but we are weighing all the options,” Ferrer said.

But the Typhoons also remain very much in play. “The Spanish air force is very linked to the Eurofighter world,” he noted.

A contract for the 20 Canary Islands-based aircraft may arrive by next year, pending government approval of funds, Ferrer said.

The air force needs to speed up the process of modernizing its fleets, the service chief of staff said in a Thursday panel at the FEINDEF conference.

The service has recently acquired aircraft that will last for decades to come, including the Airbus A400M military transport aircraft, NHIndustries NH90 helicopters, and Typhoon fighters, noted General Javier Salto Martínez-Avial. But other platforms, such as the F-5M trainer jets and the oldest F-18s, should have been renewed years ago, he added.

“To be able to make progress ... this needs to be done. We have to renew our material … to substitute what we have in the Canary Islands,” he said.

U.S. industry executives at the FEINDEF exhibition played down reports that Lockheed was involved in a veritable sales campaign, saying conversations were informal. Still, they said, for the Spanish navy to replace its Harriers the service would have to order the F-35B variant by 2024 in order for the planes to be ready in 2028, when the old jump jets are close to being phased out.

That is, if the Spanish navy opts to continue carrier-based, fixed-wing operations in the first place.

Lockheed, for its part, brought an F-35 cockpit simulator to the show here, inviting Spanish navy officials to take a gander.

21,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/11/03/us-air-force-tests-cross-country-data-sharing-across-three-flag-exercises/,defense,"WASHINGTON — For the first time, the Air Force last week carried out three major test flag events at three separate locations simultaneously to see how well the service can share data electronically across different battlespaces.

The Orange Flag, Emerald Flag and Black Flag large force test events were held Oct. 26 in California, Florida and Nevada, the Air Force said in a Monday release.

The Air Force said it used a series of data transfer networks to transmit targeting data over long distances. The tests created their own airborne Link 16 networks — the military’s main tactical data exchange network — to transmit data to ground links, and then transferred that information between each flag event.

Maj. Theodore Ellis, director of the Black Flag event at the Nevada Test and Training Range, said the experiment was a success.

“It took two months of preparation between the three separate bases and connecting 10 different agencies to culminate all three flags in a single day, at the same time, for the first time,” Ellis said in a statement to Defense News. “We are still in the process of going through all the data, but the events were executed successfully.”

Maj. Daniel Prudhomme, the director of Orange Flag at Edwards Air Force Base in California, said it was the first time the test flag enterprise had tried to connect more than two geographically-separated areas with low-latency data link networks. The Air Force previously linked Orange and Emerald flag events in June.

RELATED

Orange Flag involved aircraft such as the F-35A Lightning II and two General Atomics MQ-20 Avenger drones, which carried the Skyborg autonomy core system for a flight test that lasted several hours.

Capt. Joe Haggberg, deputy director of Emerald Flag at the Eglin Gulf Test and Training Range in Florida, said that test focused on connecting systems under the Joint All-Domain Command and Control concept. JADC2 ties systems across the services together to securely pass data between forces working in different locations.

“The [Emerald Flag] team gleaned valuable information that will fundamentally transform the way we think, fight and employ capabilities at further range,” Haggberg said.

And the Black Flag event involved testing the electronic warfare capabilities of the EC-130H Compass Call, F-15E Strike Eagle, and EA-18G Growler, testing non-traditional combat search-and-rescue methods, and other capabilities and tactics in scenarios similar to what they would encounter in actual combat.

22,https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2021/11/03/blue-flag-exercise-has-israels-enemies-seeing-red/,defense,"Israel flexed its military and political muscle last month, hosting its largest and most advanced air force exercise ever. The Blue Flag 2021 exercise included dozens of fighter aircraft from at least eight major countries and a landmark visit from the chief of the United Arab Emirates Air Force.

The exercise provided flight crews an opportunity to share best practices, improve interoperability, and refine the integration of fourth- and fifth-generation fighter aircraft operations. Much to the chagrin of those who seek to delegitimize, isolate and attack Israel, the exercise also demonstrated growing international respect for Israel as a regional leader and military power with deep operational experience.

France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States all sent fighter aircraft and personnel to Israel to participate in Blue Flag 2021. Participating aircraft included Israeli F-35Is, F-15Ds and F-16Cs; French Rafales; U.K. Typhoons; Italian F-35s and G550 early warning aircraft; German Typhoons; Greek F-16s; and Indian Mirage 2000s. The United States had wanted to send F-35A aircraft in addition to the F-16C aircraft that participated, but couldn’t due to scheduling challenges.

In total, an estimated 1,500 service members participated. Flight crews honed their air-to-air and air-to-ground skills, and practiced suppressing enemy air defenses, going up against Israeli F-16Cs from the 115th Aggressor Squadron, which modeled the capabilities and tactics of potential adversaries. These aggressor aircraft were augmented by unmanned aerial systems and helicopters as well as a Patriot battery simulating an enemy surface-to-air missile threat.

Blue Flag 2021 marked a number of historic firsts. The exercise featured the first French Rafale fighter squadron in Israel, the first Indian Mirage fighter squadron in Israel and the first British fighter squadron in Israel since the country was established in 1948.

The participation of France, the United Kingdom and India in Blue Flag 2021 suggests each government saw practical operational benefits from sending crews and aircraft to the Israeli exercise, and was happy to signal increased diplomatic support for the state of Israel.

This growing international recognition of Jerusalem’s role as a source of regional leadership and stability must be disappointing for the Islamic Republic of Iran and its terrorist proxies, who seek to attack and even destroy the state of Israel. It must also be quite frustrating for those elsewhere who seek to delegitimize and isolate Jerusalem.

Despite the efforts of Israel’s adversaries, Jerusalem now fields its most capable military ever and is more diplomatically integrated in the region than it has been since Israel’s founding. Recognizing that fact, the Pentagon moved Israel this year from U.S. European Command’s area of responsibility to that of U.S. Central Command, which includes the Middle East.

Israel’s growing regional integration was demonstrated by the Blue Flag 2021 exercise’s most important first: the visit by UAE Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Nasser Mohammed al-Alawi.

Israel and the United Arab Emirates, along with Bahrain, signed the Abraham Accords in 2020, codifying normal relations and catalyzing growing cooperation in a number of economic, scientific and social fields. Israel-UAE cooperation increasingly also includes the security sector.

A major reason for this growing cooperation is the fact that Iran continues to export terrorism that targets Israelis, Americans and Arabs alike, while inching toward a nuclear weapon capability that will endanger them all. This is incentivizing an increasingly unified and capable American, Israeli and Arab military coalition.

That dynamic was on full display on Oct. 30 in a separate development when aircraft from Israel, Bahrain, Egypt and Saudi Arabia (at different times) accompanied a U.S. B-1B strategic bomber in its flight around the Arabian Peninsula. Riyadh’s willingness to participate for a second time this year in a multilateral patrol mission involving Israel is worth noting.

The United States, Israel and their Arab partners, however, should not be satisfied with this progress. They should look for additional opportunities to deepen mutually beneficial security cooperation. This cooperation strengthens the readiness of each military, improves their ability to operate together and sends a positive deterrent message to Tehran.

The good news is that the respective militaries are already moving that direction. The Blue Flag exercise represents a “stepping-stone toward regional and international cooperation,” Israeli Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Amikam Norkin said last month. There are several immediate opportunities the United States and our Middle Eastern partners should not miss.

Terrorist threats to shipping and offshore energy infrastructure in the Middle East are growing. Israeli and Emirati ships have been attacked. Meanwhile, with Iran’s help, Hezbollah has armed itself with a variety of weapons designed to attack maritime targets, and Hamas tried to target gas installations off the Israeli coast during the Gaza conflict in May.

RELATED

To strengthen maritime capabilities and deterrence, Israel should invite the United Arab Emirates (and Egypt) to participate in the next Noble Dina exercise. This Israeli-hosted exercise focuses on maritime situational awareness, counterterrorism and port defense (among other skills), all of which would improve Israeli and Emirati security.

In the air domain, Israel should invite the United Arab Emirates to send aircraft and fighter crews to the next Blue Flag exercise in two years. For its part, Abu Dhabi should invite Israel to participate in the next UAE-hosted Desert Flag exercise.

Israel and the United Arab Emirates already participate in the Greek-hosted Iniochos exercise, last conducted in April. To extend Arab-Israeli security cooperation further, Jerusalem and Abu Dhabi should work with Athens to invite Egypt and Jordan to join the next Iniochos exercise as full participants (not simply as observers).

The Pentagon should also encourage both Israel and the United Arab Emirates to send robust contingents to the next Red Flag exercise at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.

In the land warfare domain, Abu Dhabi should invite the Israel Defense Forces to participate in the next UAE-U.S. Iron Union exercise hosted by the United Arab Emirates. There is good reason to do so: As Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett warned in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in September, “Iran plans to arm its proxies in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon with hundreds, and then thousands of these deadly drones [Shahed-136s].”

If the IDF were to attend the Iron Union exercise, Emirati, American and Israeli forces could work together, for example, to strengthen and rehearse the defense of bases and ground maneuver forces against swarms of enemy drones. Developing, fielding and honing improved defenses against drones is a top priority for U.S. Central Command, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

The United States, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and others are right to celebrate the success of the Blue Flag 2021 exercise. Given the growing threats, however, they should not spend too much time congratulating themselves and would be wise to get to work now on urgent next steps.

23,https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2021/11/01/japan-becomes-first-non-american-operator-of-kc-46a-tanker/,defense,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Boeing has delivered the first of four KC-46A tankers to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, marking the program’s first delivery to a customer outside the United States.

The aircraft, carrying the serial number 14-3611 and using the callsign REACH 46, made the trans-Pacific flight after departing Boeing’s facilities in Seattle, Washington, on Thursday afternoon local time, arriving at Miho Air Base in Japan on Friday morning local time, according to data from flight-tracking website ADS-B Exchange.

“Japan’s acquisition of KC-46A tankers marks a significant milestone for both the program and U.S.-Japan cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region and plays a critical role in the security alliance between both countries,” said Will Shaffer, president of Boeing Japan.

Shaffer added that the KC-46 will also be able to support Japan’s humanitarian and disaster relief efforts due to its ability to carry cargo and passengers.

Japan received the U.S. State Department’s approval to acquire four KC-46s in September 2016. The U.S. Air Force and the JASDF awarded Boeing a Foreign Military Sale contract for this first tanker in December 2017, and exercised an option for a second in December 2018.

The options for the third and fourth JASDF KC-46As were exercised in October 2020 under a $342 million contract.

Japan will form a new squadron for its KC-46As at Miho Air Base to operate alongside its existing tanker fleet comprised of four KC-767 and two KC-130H tankers that are assigned to 404 Hikotai at Komaki. The new tankers will help refuel the JASDF’s fleet of Lockheed Martin F-35A and F-35B Joint Strike Fighters, Mitsubishi F-15 and F-2 fighters, and Bell-Boeing MV-22 Osprey tilt rotors."

Under the firm-fixed-price contract the Air Force announced Friday, the company will supply 29 F110-GE-129 engines for the production of 12 Boeing F-15EXs. Those 29 engines include installs and spares, the Air Force said.

If all seven options are exercised, GE could provide 329 engines in all, the Air Force said. The final delivery would occur in 2031, and the engine deliveries would help produce 136 F-15EXs.

“The United States Air Force is proud to partner with General Electric as our engine manufacturer that will power America’s newest, advanced F-15 aircraft,” Brig. Gen. Dale White, the program executive officer for fighters and advanced aircraft at the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, said in the service’s release. “Not only will it reduce sustainment costs and drive down risk as it replaces our aging F-15C/D fleet, it will also deliver new capabilities that complement the existing and future [tactical air] portfolio.”

GE beat Pratt & Whitney in the competitive source selection process. Pratt & Whitney offered its F-100-PW-229 engine for the new fighter jet.

RELATED

Pratt & Whitney said it was disappointed the Air Force had not selected its F100 engine.

“We believe that we offered the most trusted, proven engine with the overall best value to the USAF for the F-15EX propulsion competition, which would deliver high performance, reliability and mission readiness for its F-15EX fleet,” Pratt & Whitney said in an emailed statement.

The first two F-15EXs, which already use the F110 engine, arrived at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida in March and April. They are now undergoing a variety of tests, including a week of operational testing at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada earlier this month.

The Pentagon said the work will be done in Cincinnati, Ohio, and San Antonio, Texas.

GE said in its release it has delivered more than 3,400 F110 engines worldwide and that they have flown more than 10.5 million hours. The F110 is also in many of the Air Force’s F-16s.

“We are honored to help the U.S. Air Force open a new chapter by providing reliable F110 power for the F-15EX,” Shawn Warren, vice president and general manager of combat and trainer engines for GE, said in a company release. “The F110 production line is active today and ready to deliver on the U.S. Air Force’s urgent and compelling requirement for an F-15EX propulsion system.”

25,https://www.defensenews.com/global/asia-pacific/2021/10/29/new-variants-of-chinese-stealth-fighters-break-cover/,defense,"MELBOURNE, Australia – Two new variants of China’s stealth fighters have broken cover in the past three days, including China’s next carrier-based fighter, hinted at during a recent air show.

Photos and videos taken outside the Chengdu Aircraft factory in its namesake city on Tuesday showed a two-seat J-20 stealth fighter in overall primer, confirming persistent rumors such a variant was being developed by the company.

The photos and video, posted on Weibo and other social media portals, distinctly showed the aircraft’s tandem cockpit as it taxied toward the runway for take-off.

It’s not clear what role the back-seater would play, although a logical explanation would be that the rear seat would be occupied by a weapons system officer, or WSO, responsible for operating the J-20′s radar and weapons.

It has also been suggested the two-seat J-20, whose exact designation is as yet unknown, would be a manned-unmanned teaming mothership, controlling China’s version of a loyal wingman or other unmanned combat aerial vehicle or UCAV.

Another possible use for a J-20 WSO is the primary sensor operator coordinating other networked, manned assets. Chinese aviation industry officials have said in the past they saw a potential use of the J-20 as a stealth airborne early warning aircraft, using multiple J-20s as a sensor net.

New carrier-borne fighter

In addition, photos surfaced earlier today of what appears to be China’s stealthy carrier-borne fighter taking to the air for the first time. As previously reported, industry officials said during the recent Zhuhai air show the new carrier-borne stealth fighter would make its first flight in 2021.

The photos also confirm the aircraft, whose exact designation is also unknown and is also left in primer, is a development of the redesigned Shenyang FC-31 stealth fighter that has also been called the J-31 in some quarters and was previously suggested as an export design.

The photos, taken while the aircraft was in flight, show the catapult launch bar on the nose landing gear and what appears to be hinges on the wings that allow them to be folded, a typical feature of carrier-based aircraft to allow the limited space on the flight deck and hangars to be maximized.

The new type will likely equip the Type 003 carrier being built at a shipyard in the coastal megacity of Shanghai, which, unlike China’s two existing carriers, will be fitted with catapults that will allow it to shorten the aircraft launch cycle, as well as enable it to operate larger and heavier aircraft such as the Xi’an KJ-600 turboprop carrier-borne airborne early warning aircraft.

Two KJ-600s have been seen on Google Earth satellite imagery, taken Oct. 2, of the airfield at Xi’an-Yanliang, where manufacturer Xi’an Aircraft Corp. has its production facilities. The aircraft measures about 17.5 meters (58 feet) in length and has a wingspan of about 25 meters (82 feet), with one painted in light grey while the other retains a green primer finish.

Two images show two Xi'an KJ-600 early warning aircraft at the Xi'an-Yanliang airfield in Xi'an, China, on Oct. 2, 2021. (Google Earth)

The two-tone gray finish on the dorsal dish-shaped radomes atop the KJ-600s suggests that their radar, which is mounted on a dorsal dish-shaped radome, has a single antenna array that will be able to rotate, giving it all-round coverage. The type was understood to have made its first flight in late August 2020.

Satellite photos of the Jiangnan-Changxing shipyard where the Type 003 carrier is being built suggest the Type 003 will be equipped with three catapults and will be roughly the same size as the U.S. Navy’s Gerald R. Ford-class carriers."

MELBOURNE, Australia — China is likely using an unused civilian airport just across the Strait of Taiwan to conduct its overflights near the island, with satellite imagery on different occasions showing military aircraft parked on the ground that correspond with Taiwanese military reports.

Shantou-Waisha airport, less than 220 miles across the strait from the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan, has played host to rotating detachments of People’s Liberation Army aircraft since at least October 2020, according to satellite imagery provided to Defense News by Planet Labs.

The mixed civilian and military airport, which used to service the city of Shantou, ceased commercial operations in 2011 when the nearby Jieyang-Chaoshan airport opened to become the city’s civilian airport.

The October 2020 imagery showed two Shaanxi KQ-200 anti-submarine warfare aircraft on what used to be the civil parking apron, with the type’s distinctive tail-mounted anomaly detector boom clearly visible.

Two similar aircraft were seen May 7, 2021, with one of these seen taxiing toward the runway in another satellite photo that has been published on Google Earth.

According to Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense, two KQ-200s — which it described as “Y-8 ASW” because the KQ-200 is based on the Y-8F airlifter — entered the southern part of its air defense identification zone, or ADIZ, on that day, flying from and returning in the direction of the city.

That type of area is airspace over which the identification and location of aircraft operating in it is monitored for national security purposes, and is separate from and may extend beyond a country’s territorial airspace to give the country more time to respond to aircraft of interest.

China’s KQ-200s have been the most common aircraft reported by Taiwan crossing into its ADIZ. The type is operated by the PLA Navy’s air arm; the nearest known units operating the platform are regiments based at Dachang in Shanghai to the north and at Qionghai on the southern Chinese island of Hainan on the fringes of the South China Sea.

In addition to the above occasions, low-resolution images of the old civil apron showed between one and three aircraft there since the middle of 2020, suggesting these deployments began at least that early.

Planet Labs also provided Defense News with photos of the airport taken Sept. 2, which showed six Sukhoi Su-27/30 Flanker aircraft, or its Chinese Shenyang J-11/16 derivatives, on the northern apron. This was followed by Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense reporting four and two Su-30s entering its ADIZ on Sept. 5 and 6, respectively, from the direction of Shantou.

While not definitive, the reports by the ministry and the presence of similar types at Shantou-Waisha on corresponding days as well as their flight tracks in and out of the zone suggest the air base is used as a convenient jumping-off point by PLA aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ.

The use of the base not only shortens transit times into the zone but also enables the PLA to attain faster access to and conduct training and/or patrols over the southern part of the Taiwan Strait, the northern part of the South China Sea and the Bashi Channel.

The channel lies between Taiwan and the Philippines, and it provides direct deep-water access to the northern part of the disputed South China Sea from the Pacific Ocean. It is also one of the several strategic chokepoints of the so-called First Island Chain.

These rotating detachments at the base are in addition to the single PLA Air Force aircraft unit resident at the base, which is believed to be operating the Chengdu J-7E interceptor. The J-7E is a development of the 1960s-era Russian MiG-21 interceptor, which China’s aviation industry has progressively improved.

The satellite images show J-7s parked at the base, although Taiwan’s ministry has not reported any of the single-engine jets crossing into its ADIZ since June 17, which was the sole occasion the ministry noted the type crossing into the zone since it began issuing daily reports in September 2020.

In addition to Shantou-Waisha, the PLA is also believed to be staging its flights over Taiwan’s ADIZ from the base of Huizhou-Huiyang. The base, which is also a civilian airport, has seen regular rotations of electronic warfare and surveillance aircraft based on the Y-8 and Y-9 airframes, including the KJ-500 airborne early warning aircraft.

The base also hosts occasional rotations of PLA tactical aircraft in addition to the two resident PLA Air Force regiments, which operate the Chengdu J-10 and Shenyang J-16 combat aircraft. These rotations have joined the former in flying inside Taiwan’s ADIZ, usually crossing into the zone flying from the west.

Xi’an JH-7 fighter-bombers were seen on satellite imagery of the base taken between late December 2020 and March 2021 that was published on Google Earth. The base is located about 300 miles west of the Taiwanese port city of Kaohsiung,

A pair of JH-7s subsequently made forays into Taiwan’s ADIZ on Feb. 19, and again the next day, marking two of just four occasions the type has done so since Taiwan began its daily reports.

China sent a record 149 PLA aircraft into the zone between Oct. 1 and 4, coinciding with China’s national day on the first of the month. They have not, however, entered or come close to Taiwanese airspace, nor have they crossed the median line over the strait that serves as the unofficial air and maritime boundary between China and Taiwan.

Depending on their flight profile, Taiwan either issues verbal warnings, scrambles interceptors or activates ground-based air defenses in response to the Chinese aircraft."
27,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/10/26/mitchell-institute-ditch-f-15ex-for-more-f-35s-new-stealth-fighters/,defense,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force should abandon its plans to revive fourth-generation fighters under the F-15EX program, and instead focus on building more F-35As and new stealthy fighter jets, according to a new paper from the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies.

Former F-16 pilot Heather Penney, a senior resident fellow at the institute, said in the paper released Monday that the F-15EX Eagle II program is a dead end — one based on outdated technology that wouldn’t suit the Air Force well in a high-end fight nor save money over the F-35 program. She expects the stealth-less F-15EX will end up playing a limited defensive role in a war, at a time when the Air Force has a limited inventory of fighters.

“Given this reality, funding limitations and modern mission demands, the Air Force should seek the soonest reasonable termination point for the F-15EX,” Penney wrote.

The Air Force should instead shift that money to boosting F-35 production and develop another fighter jet, Penney said — one that is affordable, flexible and has stealth capability. This would be in addition to the highly classified Next Generation Air Dominance program that would start fielding sometime in the 2030s, to which Penney said the Air Force should commit wholeheartedly.

In underscoring the importance of fielding stealthy fighters, Penney pointed to the Air Force’s recent experience in Syria. The country possessed Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, which the U.S. Air Force could only counter by deploying F-22s and F-35s, she said.

And other potential foes, such as China, Russia and Iran, will undoubtedly field that air defense system or something similar, requiring the American service to fight with something more capable than a fourth-generation fighter.

“Any modern battlespace will require advanced stealth capabilities, just as the cost of entry,” Penney said.

And if the Air Force allows a capability gap in its fighter force, Penny said, that could give China the opening it seeks to quickly and decisively seize Taiwan.

The Mitchell Institute counts several defense contractors among its financial backers, including Boeing, which makes the F-15EX, and Lockheed Martin, which makes the F-35. The institute said this report was paid for out of its general funds, and not bankrolled by particular contractors.

In addition to pulling the plug on the F-15EX, Penney said the Air Force should completely divest its other F-15s — the “C,” “D,” and “E” models — as well as the A-10 Warthog from its fleet. Those retirements should happen on a one-to-one basis as F-35s come online, she added.

She also called on the service to extend its legacy F-16s to provide air power in permissive environments, as well as retaining and continuing to modernize the F-22 Raptor until the Next Generation Air Dominance and other programs are battle-capable. Little is publicly known about the Air Force’s secretive and experimental NGAD program, although the service confirmed last year that it quickly designed, built and flew a prototype — years ahead of schedule.

When asked what she wanted to see from NGAD, Penney responded: “Range and payload.”

The Air Force will need a future fighter that can penetrate deep into enemy territory, with enough firepower to destroy mobile or difficult targets, she explained. Trying to hit targets from a distance won’t cut it, she added.

“It does not make sense to build a standoff force” that would strike targets from a distance, Penney said. “It’s simply too expensive. It’s not operationally effective. You must have penetration and ... be a stand-in force whenever you execute … prolonged combat operations.”

28,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/10/26/raytheon-ceo-air-force-may-not-be-able-to-afford-new-f-35-engine/,defense,"WASHINGTON — The Air Force may decide that it can’t afford to build an entirely new, advanced engine for its F-35A Lightning II fighter jet, the Raytheon Technologies chief executive said Tuesday.

In 2016, the Air Force awarded Raytheon-owned Pratt & Whitney and General Electric Aviation each a billion-dollar contract to develop a new F-35A engine under the Adaptive Engine Transition Program. This engine is intended to deliver better fuel efficiency and thrust by using a third stream of air.

However, Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes said in a call with analysts Tuesday morning paying for the new adaptive engine will be a “tough putt” for the Air Force.

Because the adaptive engine could not be used in the F-35B, the Marine Corps’ vertical takeoff and landing variant or the Navy’s carrier-based F-35C, Hayes said the Air Force would bear its entire development cost.

GE said on its website that while its engine is still in testing, it has been designed to be used in both the F-35A and F-35C variants.

RELATED

The Air Force is also considering sticking with and upgrading the F-35′s F135 engine, which Pratt & Whitney also builds, instead of adopting a new engine.

Hayes said his company has talked to the F-35 Joint Program Office about ways to upgrade the current engine to provide more cooling and thrust “in a significantly lower cost than a brand-new centerline engine,” which will be more important as its Block 4 version is rolled out.

He said Pratt & Whitney did ground tests of its adaptive engine this past summer, and plans to do flight tests early next year.

Hayes told analysts the F-35 could be re-engined around 2027 or 2028 — but called that time frame “extremely aggressive.”

Meanwhile, he said during the same call the end of the Afghanistan war and the U.S. withdrawal is expected to cost the company $75 million this year in services it was providing to the now-defunct Afghan government.

During its call with analysts Tuesday, Lockheed Martin said supply chain issues took a toll on its businesses.

John Mollard, acting chief financial officer for the contractor, said vendors that supply components to both the civilian and defense markets — such as landing gear or brakes — have been particularly hurt by sales declines on the commercial side. That’s led to supply chain shortages that affected some of Lockheed’s production efforts.

“We need our supply chain to be successful for us to be successful,” Mollard said.

He said Lockheed has recently come to an agreement with the JPO on a plan for expected deliveries of F-35s. He said the company expects deliveries will increase to 156 by 2023 and stay there for the foreseeable future, even though F-35 sales are expected to drop in 2022.

29,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/10/25/air-force-holds-week-of-f-15ex-tests-at-nellis/,defense,"WASHINGTON — The Air Force is wrapping up the first weeklong operational test of its two new F-15EX Eagle II fighter jets.

The F-15EXs, updated versions of the fourth-generation F-15 jet, took part in their first major test with the Air Force at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada from Oct. 18 to Oct. 25. The fighters — so far, the only F-15EXs that have been built — flew alongside F-15Cs and F-15Es, the Air Force said in a Friday release.

Maj. Kevin Hand, one of the test pilots who flew the F-15EX, said in the release the tests were intended to highlight the differences between it and the older C model — particularly its digital flight control system making it a fly-by-wire aircraft. The F-15C uses a hydromechanical system for its flight controls.

The Air Force also set out to test the EX’s Eagle Passive/Active Warning and Survivability System, an electronic warfare system.

“The EPAWS system is the next-gen advanced electronic attacks, as well as electronic protects, system that the EX and Strike Eagles are currently testing and developing and hopefully fielding in the relatively near future,” Hand said. “That’s going to give us the ability to essentially go into some of these more advanced threats or aerial denial kind of situations where we can now self-protect and self-jam our way through.”

The Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center Detachment 6 is heading up the initial operational test and evaluation effort for the F-15EX.

The first two F-15EXs arrived at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida earlier this year, with tail number 001 delivered in March and the second, 002, in April.

Lt. Col. Kenneth Juhl, an F-15 tester for the test and evaluation center, said conducting the tests at Nellis’s air-to-air and surface-to-air training ranges will help yield the best quality data to assess how well the systems worked.

Although pilots are in the thick of the test flights, Juhl said, their perception on what is happening may not always be accurate.

“Oftentimes, we go out there as pilots, and we think that the airplane works as well as it should, but behind the scenes, we dig into some of the instrumentation, and it wasn’t exactly what we remembered,” Juhl said. “Every so often, we need the instrumentation folks to help us out with what was really going on.”

Besides providing instant feedback, Juhl said, the data can also be scrutinized to locate potential problems and determine how to quickly fix them.

Before the tests at Nellis, the fighters had gone through developmental tests to evaluate proper specifications and safety standards. In May, both F-15EXs also took part in the Northern Edge joint training exercise in Alaska to test how well the aircraft performs when its GPS, radar and other systems are at risk of being jammed.

Once the Nellis tests are done, the fighters will fly back to Eglin for more developmental tests.

“We’ll be transitioning back into developmental tests for the remainder of this year and going into next year, as we continue to test the additional capability of the platform to include the additional weapon stations and additional Operational Flight Program upgrades,” F-15EX test project manager Colton Myers said.

After that, Juhl hopes to get the F-15EX out to future exercises such as Red Flag-Nellis to gather additional performance data.

30,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/10/21/booster-rocket-failure-scuttles-hypersonic-test/,defense,"A hypersonic technology test the Defense Department hoped to carry out in Alaska Thursday went awry when a booster rocket failed in a launch attempt.

In a statement, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Timothy Gorman said the booster that failed was not part of the hypersonic program, and was not related to the common hypersonic glide body. The test took place at the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Kodiak, Alaska.

Reuters first reported the test’s failure.

A defense official told Defense News the rocket made it off the launch pad before failing.

Gorman said program officials have launched a review to determine what caused the booster system to fail so they can improve future tests. He noted this missile booster is only used for testing purposes.

“Experiments and tests both successful and unsuccessful are the backbone of developing highly complex critical technologies at tremendous speed, as the department is doing with hypersonic technologies,” Gorman said. “Delivering hypersonic weapons remains a top priority and the department remains confident that it is on track to field offensive hypersonic capabilities beginning in the early 2020s.”

The Army and Navy also announced Thursday they had conducted a separate test of hypersonic technologies Wednesday at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Virginia.

Hypersonic weapons, which are highly maneuverable and capable of flying at more than Mach 5, are one of the Pentagon’s top priorities.

In August, China tested a space-based hypersonic missile. Experts say that test is not likely to spark a new arms race, but could affect how the White House and Pentagon form its missile defense and nuclear posture strategies.

31,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/10/21/uncharted-waters-with-no-hyten-successor-in-sight-dod-prepares-to-delegate-vice-chair-jobs/,defense,"WASHINGTON — With one month before the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Hyten, retires, the Biden administration has not yet announced a nominee to replace him.

And experts worry that, even if a nomination were to come in the next few days, time is running out to get a new vice chair approved before Hyten’s term expires Nov. 21. Having a gap in the vice chair position could create multiple problems as the Pentagon does crucial work on future budgets and resource allocations, they say.

“Holy smokes, there’s no vice [chair] nomination pending,” Arnold Punaro, a former Senate Armed Services Committee staff director and retired Marine Corps major general, said in an Oct. 15 interview. “This is really ... uncharted waters. I’ve not seen this before.”

But the Joint Staff has discussed how to handle Hyten’s multiple — and critical — roles and responsibilities if a successor is not in place a month from now.

A defense official with knowledge of the process told Defense News Hyten would likely spend some of his final days in office delegating his duties to other officials on the Joint Staff during the period before his successor is sworn in. Those officials could include Vice Adm. Lisa Franchetti, director for strategy, plans and policy, or Lt. Gen. James Mingus, director of operations for the Joint Staff.

But, the official said, there would not be an acting vice chairman named. And he said he expects only officers from the Joint Staff, not from individual services, to be tapped to fill in for Hyten.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense referred other questions about the status of the nomination to the White House, which declined to comment.

Politico reported U.S. Fleet Forces commander Adm. Christopher Grady is the likely nominee to be the next vice chair, but noted Adm. Charles Richard, head of U.S. Strategic Command, has also emerged as a contender.

But even if Grady, Richard or someone else were to be nominated in the next few days, experts say, it would likely take weeks to properly vet them, hold a Senate nomination hearing and bring them up for votes in the Senate Armed Services Committee and full Senate.

Retired Air Force Gen. Herbert “Hawk” Carlisle, former head of Air Combat Command who now is president and chief executive of the National Defense Industrial Association, said Oct. 20 he’s nervous about the delay and the potential for the Joint Chiefs to have no vice chair during a key budgetary period.

“If that happens, that would be really detrimental, potentially very harmful to the Department of Defense,” Carlisle said.

Punaro said he can’t recall any time in his four decades in the defense world when the vice chair nomination has been cut so close.

“This is the second-most senior military official in the entire Pentagon,” Punaro said. “The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is not something that should be done at the last minute.”

And with Congress already stressed and juggling multiple high-stakes bills — including contentious negotiations over reconciliation and infrastructure bills, appropriations bills and the debt ceiling in December — its bandwidth for taking on the nomination process in a short timeframe is limited.

But experts said those duties are so important they need a vice chair in place.

For example, Punaro noted, Hyten serves as co-chair, along with Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, of the Defense Management Council. This council makes major budgetary decisions, particularly needed now that the review process is underway for the fiscal 2023 program objective memorandum, which helps set the services’ plans for how they will allocate future resources.

The vice chair also leads the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, which supervises the development of new capabilities and acquisition efforts and helps set the direction for the military’s procurements decades in the future.

Carlisle said that council’s work needs someone in charge, particularly as the military continues to stand up the Space Force, improve cyber capabilities and adjust to focusing on great power competition against potential adversaries like China and Russia.

It’s unclear what is delaying the nomination.

Wes Hallman, senior vice president for strategy and policy at NDIA, said the lack of a vice chair nominee tracks with the overall slow pace of DoD nominations coming from the White House. That lack of urgency concerns NDIA, he said.

“This is not a ceremonial position,” Hallman added. “This is a real position of impact.”

Punaro said he doesn’t think the Pentagon is the holdup, but it’s possible the nomination is bottled up somewhere in the White House’s bureaucracy. If that’s the case, he said, the Pentagon is probably pinging the White House on a regular basis to shake it loose.

“I have a hard time understanding what valid excuse there could be for not getting this done in a timely fashion,” Punaro said. “The nomination should already be in the Senate.”

It’s also possible extenuating circumstances behind the scenes may be the source of the delay. That could include an issue that emerged in the vetting process.

After his own nomination, Hyten’s confirmation was delayed as Congress investigated new sexual assault allegations. However, he was eventually confirmed.

Whenever the nomination comes through, Punaro said, the Senate Armed Services Committee will move quickly to get it through.

“They’re not going to be happy they got it at the last minute,” he said. “But they’re going to bend over backwards to do a thorough hearing, an objective hearing, not cut any corners. There’s still time to get this through so there’s no gap. … But we’re running out of airspeed and altitude.”

32,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/10/20/fund-the-f-35-program-lawmakers-tell-the-white-house/,defense,"WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of lawmakers is urging the White House to fully fund the F-35 Lightning II program in the coming years.

But Senate appropriators are raising concerns about maintenance challenges facing the advanced fifth-generation fighter, and this week questioned the need to buy more F-35s right now.

In a Wednesday letter to President Biden, 89 lawmakers, including Reps. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, and Mike Turner, R-Ohio, said the United States needs to keep investing in F-35s in the fiscal 2023 Defense Department budget request and the Future Years Defense Plan. Veasey and Turner are co-chairs of the congressional Joint Strike Fighter Caucus.

The Pentagon needs to buy at least 100 F-35s for the U.S. military each year, invest in advanced capabilities to stay ahead of threats from adversaries and provide enough funding to sustain the aircraft for decades, the lawmakers wrote in the letter, though they did not spell out specific funding levels.

“It is disappointing that year after year DoD continues to flat-line F-35 production investments, defer needed readiness funding, and underfund advanced capabilities for this critical fleet,” they wrote.

RELATED

“The F-35 is also an unrivaled national asset that strengthens national security, enhances global partnerships and powers economic growth across our communities,” the lawmakers added. “As you well know, our adversaries continue to advance surface-to-air missile systems and develop their own stealth fighters at an astonishing pace.”

This is particularly concerning, they said, with Air Force fighters nearing an average age of three decades old and the cost to operate and support older aircraft increasing.

“The U.S. must modernize our fighter inventory to ensure we can sustain a strong national defense and maintain an advantage to counter the pacing threat — China,” they wrote.

The lawmakers pointed to the importance of the F-35 to the nation’s manufacturing base, with more than 1,800 suppliers and 254,000 workers playing some part in the program.

“At a time when our economy has suffered the devastating effects of COVID-19, this program has continued to create jobs, foster workforce development and spur economic opportunity,” the letter said.

The Senate Appropriations Committee on Monday also released its version of the fiscal 2022 defense appropriations bill, which calls for hundreds of millions in additional funding to expand depot activities, add more spare engine power modules and improve sustainment for the Air Force’s F-35s.

But in the explanatory statement accompanying the bill, the committee noted delays in fielding the aircraft and threw cold water on calls for procuring more now.

The committee said the F-35 program has had “significant maintenance challenges primarily resulting from power module failures combined with depot repair capacity issues.” This has the committee worried because it has left the military with fewer F-35s available for operations at a time when fewer new F-35s are being delivered.

The committee called for an additional $175 million to more quickly stand up Air Force depot activities, $175 million for F135 spare engine power modules and another $185 million in operation and maintenance funding for sustainment.

The committee said production delays in the F-35 will cause some aircraft deliveries to fall behind schedule. The F-35 Program Executive Officer is revising the delivery schedule to smooth production through 2025, the committee said in the statement.

But, it said, this will mean delays in the fielding of about 34 F-35s.

Because of that, the committee said that while it’s supported procuring more aircraft in past years, “the committee sees the rebaseline as a necessary adjustment, and believes the fact-of-life realities do not justify supporting additional aircraft at this time.”

33,https://www.defensenews.com/artificial-intelligence/2021/10/20/us-air-force-teams-with-uk-on-machine-learning-demo/,defense,"WASHINGTON — The Air Force Research Laboratory successfully demonstrated new joint machine learning algorithms with the United Kingdom, showcasing the countries’ ability to collaborate on deploying artificial intelligence in support of war fighters.

The cooperation between the Air Force Research Laboratory and the U.K.’s Defense Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) is part of a four-year Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence Collaboration (AAIC) Partnership Agreement signed in December 2020. While AFRL is the lead agency for the partnership, the Office of the Under Secretary for Research and Engineering, the Navy and the Army are also participating. This was the first event in a series of planned demonstrations.

The demonstration took place simultaneously at AFRL’s Information Directorate in New York and Dstl’s Salisbury location in the U.K. on Oct. 18. During the event, the two countries simulated a combat scenario with U.K. and U.S. forces adjacent to one another. Using a common platform, operators were able to share data and machine learning algorithms to support wide-area situational awareness, giving brigades better information for decision making.

“The October 18 event demonstrated how the U.K. and U.S. can integrate AI technology to create the first end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) research, development, and deployment ecosystem enabling rapid data sharing, algorithm development, evaluation, and deployment. AI will play a critical role in accelerating decision making to meet the pace & scale of the future battlespace,” said AFRL project lead Lee Seversky.

The U.K. was able to showcase its model cards, which allow commanders to rapidly understand and select the best machine learning algorithms to apply to a mission. The U.S. was able to use the government-owned StreamlinedML, an open platform where users can build machine learning workflows, evaluate models and then deploy them. AFRL said the two countries used 15 machine learning algorithms, 12 data sets and five automated machine learning workflows during the event.

“This collaboration with AFRL & the U.S. services is crucial to drive the very latest AI technology into military operations and innovative research in both nations. The demonstration is just the first step toward our ambition of deploying novel AI that can learn in the field into an experimental trial environment, something that hasn’t been done before and is only possible due to this collaboration,” said Todd Robinson, who heads up the U.K.’s involvement in the partnership.

34,https://www.defensenews.com/global/asia-pacific/2021/10/20/china-shows-off-drones-recycled-from-soviet-era-fighter-jets/,defense,"MELBOURNE, Australia – China has for the first time showed off retired 1950s era fighter jets that have been converted to unmanned drones, with satellite photos of two of its east coast bases near Taiwan showing a large number of the jets on site.

The People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command published the photos of two Shenyang J-6s on its Weibo social media account during a post about the ceremony marking the start of the training cycle for the second half of 2021 for a training brigade.

The photos were taken at an unknown airfield, with the ceremony also including a banner for the occasion that was digitally altered to remove the identity of the training brigade. The five-digit serial numbers on the J-6s that would identify the unit they belong to have also been digitally blurred.

Speaking of J-6s, the PLA’s Eastern Theater Command recently released photos showing the PLAAF’s J-6 unmanned aircraft conversion. Blurred serials suggest active service; at least 50 can be seen in @planet imagery from September at 1 of 2 bases known to be operating the type pic.twitter.com/HvvMrpnjtB — Mike Yeo 杨启铭 (@TheBaseLeg) October 20, 2021

This practice of blurring the serial numbers, which could be used to identify the unit the aircraft is assigned to, is common to officially released images of People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) aircraft, suggesting that the J-6s are still in active service.

Both aircraft were otherwise left unpainted, although both carried three hardpoints for external stores on each wing.

The J-6 is a Chinese copy of the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 interceptor, whose manned version was officially retired from PLAAF service in 2010. By that time, the type was regarded as obsolete by all measures, with the basic J-6 not even equipped with a radar.

Since then, numerous J-6s have been seen on satellite imagery of two airbases in China’s coastal provinces opposite Taiwan. The airframes on these bases, Liancheng in Fujian province and Yangtang-li, which is also known as Xingning, in neighbouring Guangdong province, are parked in neat rows at the airbases.

Reports emerged from 2013 that China had converted the type into unmanned aircraft, for use either as a decoy to overwhelm adversary air defences by their sheer numbers or as a rudimentary unmanned combat aircraft.

A satellite photo of Liancheng, taken on Sept. 15 and provided to Defense News by Planet Labs, showed 50 J-6s on the group, with nine of these pictured next to the base’s 7,830-foot runway.

Updated imagery for Xingning is not available, however satellite imagery taken in April 2020 showed 29 J-6s at the base, with older satellite imagery of the base published on Google Earth showing aircraft taxiing on the ground in March 2013, October 2014, and as recently as December 2018.

They have also been seen at different parts of the bases in satellite photos taken over the years, further suggesting that these aircraft are active and have not been mothballed.

Liancheng and Xingning are some 275 miles away from Taiwan, putting the self-governing island that China sees as a rogue province well within range of the J-6. China has yet to officially acknowledge the existence of the conversion of the J-6 into unmanned aircraft."
35,https://www.defensenews.com/newsletters/daily-news-roundup/2021/10/19/l3harris-first-flight-of-future-compass-call-paves-way-for-2022-delivery/,defense,"WASHINGTON — The airplane that will one day be the Air Force’s next electronic warfare aircraft, the EC-37B Compass Call, has made its first flight and the contractor handling the program says it is on track to be delivered to the service for testing next year.

The current version of the Compass Call, the EC-130H, played a lesser-known — but vital — role in the last two decades of war in the Middle East region, jamming the communications and bomb transmissions of militant groups such as the Taliban and Islamic State. But those decades-old air frames — some of which date back to the Vietnam War era — are aging and sorely need replacing.

The Air Force in 2017 awarded a contract to L3Harris Technologies to carry out the Compass Call’s crossdeck program, which transplants the electronic warfare equipment from the legacy EC-130Hs into new Gulfstream G550 business jets. BAE Systems handles the electronic warfare components of the Compass Call.

L3Harris has carried out roughly a dozen test flights of its first Compass Call at the Gulfstream facility in Savannah, Georgia, Luke Savoie, president of the company’s aviation services sector, said in a Monday interview. The initial flight of the new Compass Call took place Aug. 25.

These flight tests — including high-altitude flights at around 40,000 feet and other tests to make sure it can operate in low temperatures — are meant to certify the structural changes L3Harris made to the aircraft to accommodate the massive amounts of electronic equipment it will carry, Savoie said.

“It’s about waking the aircraft up after its modification, before it gets into its next phase,” Savoie said.

The Air Force currently flies G550s under the designation C-37B to transport high-ranking government or Defense Department officials around the world.

But instead of luxury cabins and plush seating for VIPs, the EC-37B will be packed with a broad array of electronics meant to sow confusion in enemy ranks.

In a 2017 interview with Air Force Times, the former commander of the 43rd Expeditionary Electronic Combat Squadron said the Compass Call’s job in the war against ISIS was to jam their communications and radar on a daily basis.

“The bottom line is, if you can’t talk, you can’t fight,” then-Lt. Col. Josh Koslov, who is now a colonel, said at the time. “Our job is to create massive confusion in the [ISIS] network.”

Savoie said the EC-37B, when complete, will be able to fly much higher and faster than the older Compass Calls. The Air Force said the EC-130H has a ceiling of 25,000 feet and can hit 300 miles per hour. But Savoie said G550s can typically fly into the mid-40,000 foot range and nearly twice that speed, expanding the range of what its EW systems can target.

“Twice the altitude is twice the horizon, that you can see the world that you can affect and interact with,” Savoie said. “It’s all about altitude and speed.”

But because the EC-37B is based on the commercially available G550, and not a military-specific airframe, Savoie said it is expected to be easier for the Air Force to maintain. The new Compass Call will be able to be maintained primarily in the field, he said, without the need for significant depot maintenance time like the decades-old EC-130Hs require. This, he added, will mean less aircraft downtime.

Flying the older EC-130Hs in the harsh and dusty Middle East environment for decades proved taxing. Maintainers needed to regularly inspect the airframes for structural weaknesses and watch out for problems with its wiring and engines. Maintaining the new electronic warfare equipment that had been added to the old planes — one of which first flew in 1964 — also was a significant challenge.

The modification to the G550s to make them into Compass Calls will take place in two phases, Savoie said. The first phase, conducted in Savannah, involves modifying the exterior, including expanding the aircraft’s side panels, nose, and tail and installing radomes, external arrays and antennas. L3Harris is also installing the bulk of the wiring harnesses, liquid cooling systems and power distribution systems in that phase.

During the design process, Savoie said, L3Harris used as a blueprint the way G550s were previously modified into the Conformal Airborne Early Warning, or CAEW, aircraft flown by Israel and Singapore’s air forces. Following the CAEW design, instead of creating a new design, simplified the process and reduced risk, he said.

The flight tests went smoothly, he said, with no flutter problems or other issues that can arise when modifying aircraft with unique shapes.

But when an aircraft is modified, factors such as the center of gravity also change, he said. So L3Harris had to ensure autopilot functions and avionics, among other items, were responding to how the aircraft is currently shaped and operating correctly.

“Obviously, whenever you make significant outer mold line changes to an aircraft, [there are] tweaks to the avionics, especially advanced systems like Gulfstream employs,” Savoie said. “That’s what our flight test has proven out, that those changes have been effective.”

In the second phase, which will take place at the L3Harris facility in Waco, Texas, the company will install mission-specific hardware, such as crew consoles and stations. L3Harris already conducts depot maintenance for EC-130s in its Waco facility.

The electronic warfare equipment that will be installed in the new Compass Calls will partly be drawn from the legacy aircraft, and partly new equipment, Savoie said. Some parts in the older aircraft needed more miniaturization; in other cases, components were obsolete or outdated.

“We are incorporating the DNA of the EC-130H — not just the DNA, we’re doing organ transplants,” Savoie said.

Over the EC-130H’s two decades in the Middle East, Savoie said, the Air Force learned it needed to be agile and quickly adjust to handle emerging threats or counter new capabilities.

The EC-37B is intended to be similarly agile, by making it easy to add new capabilities — likely with software updates — when the need arises, he said.

Savoie said L3Harris’ first Compass Call, known as aircraft one, is expected to finish the first phase modifications this month. At the same time, the company has started laying the groundwork for the second phase by conducting preassemblies and creating a mockup aircraft. The first aircraft is expected to arrive in Waco at the end of October.

L3Harris is working on modifying six aircraft into EC-37Bs, Savoie said, and the Air Force eventually hopes to have 10 in its fleet.

L3Harris will finish modifying the first EC-37B in 2022 and deliver it to the Air Force for its own developmental test cycle by the end of next year, he said. He declined to say when the following EC-37Bs might be delivered.

36,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/10/17/turkey-us-proposed-to-sell-it-f-16-fighters/,defense,"ANKARA — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Oct. 17 the United States has proposed the sale of a batch of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey to compensate Turkey’s $1.4 billion investment in the U.S.-led multinational F-35 program.

Turkey committed to buy more than 100 F-35s, but was removed from the program after it decided to purchase the Russian-made S-400 long-range air and anti-missile defense system.

Erdogan has been pressing the Biden administration either to deliver the two F-35s built for the Turkish military or return Turkey’s $1.4 billion payment for the aircraft.

Turkey’s current fleet of more than 200 F-16s will be phased out by 2035. Nearly 100 aircraft in the fleet await upgrades.

Turkey also is struggling to build the TF-X, its first indigenous fighter jet, and is aiming to fly the stealth aircraft in 2025 or 2026."
37,https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/2021/10/15/kc-46-gets-new-refueling-approvals-for-transcom-missions/,defense,"WASHINGTON — The KC-46 Pegasus is now able to refuel the Air Force’s fourth-generation fighter jets during missions for U.S. Transportation Command, expanding the service’s air refueling capacity and the capability of its newest tanker.

Air Mobility Command announced Friday the Pegasus has been approved to refuel all F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon variants during TRANSCOM-tasked missions under its third interim capability release approval.

The Air Force previously used the Pegasus’ boom to refuel F-15s and F-16s during non-TRANSCOM missions such as testing and training flights, AMC spokesman Col. Damien Pickart said. Those jets do not use drogue systems to refuel.

RELATED

But this approval will allow the Pegasus to take on more missions the Air Force otherwise would have had to hand off to the KC-135 Stratotanker and KC-10 Extender and lessen the burden on those older tankers, AMC said in a release.

“The KC-46 can now support 62 percent of all receiver aircraft that request air refueling support from USTRANSCOM,” said Brig. Gen. Ryan Samuelson, who is in charge of the KC-46 cross functional team, in the announcement. “This step forward accelerates the critical projection and connection warfighting requirements the Pegasus brings to the joint force, even before it’s fully operational.”

AMC Commander Gen. Mike Minihan on Wednesday signed off on the KC-46′s latest approval.

AMC last hit such a milestone in August, when the KC-46 was approved to refuel the B-52 Stratofortress, C-17 Globemaster and other Pegasus aircraft using its refueling boom.

And the first interim capability release decision in July cleared the Pegasus to refuel aircraft using its centerline drogue system.

The Air Force said it will continue to roll out additional expansions of the Pegasus’ capabilities as its ICR process unfolds, though it would not say how long it might take. The plan focuses on “establishing incremental confidence measures” that allow AMC’s commander and other senior leaders to assess how the Pegasus is doing.

The Pegasus has so far carried out more than 6,000 missions since January 2019. Over that period, it has refueled aircraft with more than 35 million pounds of fuel, and made about 26,000 boom and 1,500 drogue contacts with other aircraft.

The Pegasus has been working to resolve a series of technical problems throughout its troubled rollout. As of August, the aircraft had six Category 1 deficiencies, though the Air Force said it is working with Boeing to resolve some of these issues.

38,https://www.defensenews.com/news/your-air-force/2021/10/14/biden-nominates-former-faa-official-ravi-chaudhary-as-air-force-installations-boss/,defense,"President Joe Biden plans to nominate Ravi Chaudhary, a former Federal Aviation Administration official who served in the Air Force for more than 20 years, as the Air Force’s next assistant secretary for installations, environment and energy on Thursday, a White House official tells Air Force Times.

If confirmed by the Senate, Chaudhary would take over a massive portfolio spanning Air Force and Space Force installations worldwide as the service grapples with the effects of deferred maintenance and climate change. He’ll also have a key role in managing the privatized housing used by airmen and guardians and reforms to how the military does business with those landlords.

Chaudhary most recently served as the director of advanced programs and innovation in the FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation for nearly three years. In that job, he oversaw research and development programs related to space travel, and was involved in regulating the budding commercial space industry from December 2017 to August 2020, according to his public LinkedIn profile.

RELATED

Prior to that he worked as the FAA’s executive director of regions and center operations for three years, handling regulatory oversight and management of the aviation agency’s operations, safety, emergency readiness, facilities management and more, according to LinkedIn.

Chaudhary dealt with programs in that role — such as the “Next-Generation Air Transportation System” technologies and policies aimed at modernizing the U.S. air traffic enterprise — that echo the same infrastructure issues he will face in the Air Force.

“Our current air traffic system is based on infrastructure that was built 50 years ago and is becoming increasingly costly to maintain,” he told a Women in Aviation International gathering in 2015. “Deploying NextGen throughout our [National Airspace System] by involving industry, government and academic stakeholders will enhance widespread benefits, both in dollars and environmental benefits through fuel savings and reduced carbon emissions.”

Chaudhary’s profile shows he has been self-employed as an aerospace and defense executive since August 2020. The Georgetown University Space Initiative, which he advises, noted in May that Chaudhary was chief executive officer of Virginia-based Falcon Innovations Aerospace, Training and Strategy.

Upon confirmation, he would replace John Henderson, who joined the Air Force secretariat in 2018 following a 23-year career in the Army Corps of Engineers. Henderson left the post in January, as is typical for political nominees when the presidency changes hands.

RELATED

Jennifer Miller, the deputy assistant secretary, has been in the job on an acting basis since Henderson departed.

The Air Force estimated in 2019 that it faced a $33 billion backlog in deferred costs for base maintenance, construction and renovation projects. It proposed a sweeping plan that includes divesting, demolishing, converting or consolidating 5 percent of its total facility square footage over 20 years.

The service owned nearly 448 million square feet of buildings, leased about 5.2 million square feet, and listed about 17 million square feet as “other” in the United States and U.S. territories alone, as of a fiscal year 2018 Pentagon report.

In January, the service released a new energy strategic plan to become a more ecofriendly, fuel-efficient force and to better weather power outages — a concern spotlighted by the devastating effects of Texas’s power grid failure earlier this year that affected residential, commercial and military buildings alike.

RELATED

“This plan captures major shifts in the department’s approach to installation energy,” said Mark Correll, deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for environment, safety and infrastructure. “By placing a greater focus on resilience and mission, the strategic plan will create an enterprise that is ultimately more prepared to deliver energy and water when and where it is needed to protect the nation, its values, and its interests.”

The Air Force is also in the process of rebuilding Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, and Offutt AFB, Nebraska, after natural disasters caused major damage there, and is trying to prepare other bases to withstand similar effects of hurricanes, wildfires, sea level rise and more.

Chaudhary, who graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy before going on to fly the C-17 Globemaster III transport plane in combat and around the world, has also worked on the GPS constellation and supported NASA’s International Space Station program.

The Obama administration alum joined the President’s Advisory Commission on Asian American and Pacific Islanders as a lieutenant colonel in 2014. He has documented instances of racism and hate against AAPI service members for more than a decade, including in a report on those challenges in 2017.

“We must move past the discussion of diversity or the mission,” Chaudhary, a Hindu and the son of Indian immigrants, wrote in a May op-ed. “‘Diversity for the mission’ must be the new mantra in our fight. … Diversity must become forever synonymous with our military’s combat edge, and a critical piece of our national security strategy.”

39,https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/ausa/2021/10/12/heres-how-army-aviation-is-tackling-the-open-architecture-challenge/,defense,"WASHINGTON —The Army aviation branch, which has long been seeking a modular open systems architecture for future aircraft, is refocusing its attention on past failures and new processes to ensure these next-generation aircraft are able to seamlessly receive new capability.

The service is trying to develop and field two future vertical lift aircraft: the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft and the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft, both by about 2030.

The Army has struggled to produce new aircraft in recent decades, and critics argue the service is being too ambitious in pursuing two aircraft at once. But additional investments in MOSA upfront could help the Army successfully integrate capability at a lower cost by continuously boosting competition, a recent Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments report found.

In creating an “open ecosystem,” MOSA would “help avoid costly and time-consuming redesign to accommodate both hardware and software upgrades by making standards and interfaces readily available,” the report said.

RELATED

MOSA could also reduce long-term operations and sustainment costs, which often account for much more of a program’s cost — roughly 70 percent — over its life cycle, the report found.

MOSA is not “a complex thing to understand,” Brig. Gen. Robert Barrie, the service’s program executive officer for aviation, said in an interview with Defense News ahead of the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference.

“The thought is that we want to invest in capability once and then we want to be able to apply that capability very affordably across multiple platforms,” he continued. “To date, we have been immensely challenged in our ability to do that.”

Maj. Gen. Wally Rugen, who is in charge of Army Future Vertical Lift modernization, said during the same interview that the “approach gives us an opportunity to address the real critical path on affordability.”

Barrie said an example of how MOSA might be used is that the Army would require a vendor to modularize the design of an aircraft engine so it can perform maintenance or replace individual modules without replacing the entire engine.

“This leads to both significant cost savings and an increased readiness of our aircraft,” he said, noting those are two of the program office’s MOSA objectives.

The Army is also requiring adherence to government-defined interfaces and use of identified consensus-based standards, according to Barrie. This is meant to allow the service to better manage integration and modification to the platforms and systems “so that they are more cost effective, result in quicker tech insertions and reduce supply chain risks.”

Developing a capability once and applying it across the fleet will also schedule pressure, he added.

The Army has been working on MOSA for over a decade, Rugen said. Much of that was during the Army’s Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstration, in which two competitive demonstrator aircraft flew over the course of several years.

“I don’t want to oversell it, but we’ve had some initial prototyping out at Project Convergence and Edge 21 to understand some of the use cases within MOSA,” Rugen said, “They’ve been blunt instruments, but we’ve moved the ball and then that’s fed back into the architecture working group” within PEO Aviation.

Project Convergence is an annual assessment of how emerging technology and tactics, techniques and procedures can come together to defeat advanced adversaries with high-end capabilities in a future fight. The exercise is kicking off this month. Edge 21, conducted in May, evaluated capabilities for the aerial tier in preparation for Project Convergence.

The Army has looked at past failures with MOSA. Barrie said the problems were often related to the service’s lack of a good governance process to manage who determines the systems and architecture used for each aircraft.

“We didn’t have policy written both inside the PEO and the Army that said these are the guiding principles of an open system approach and here’s how you will, from a policy perspective, develop these things,” he said.

The Army also didn’t align its investments properly, and requirements were not written to address an open systems approach, he noted.

PEO Aviation has established a MOSA transformation office as one way to stay organized in the process. Before any investment in a program is made on any capability on a platform now, it gets run through the office to determine if it meets MOSA criteria, Barrie said.

“If it doesn’t, why?” he added. “And we can bring it forward and make recommendations about how we can do it in a better way.”

An architecture collaboration working group, consisting of over 700 participants across academia and industry, is working with the FVL modernization team to ensure it’s moving in the right direction on MOSA.

The Army would define MOSA success as an architecture that gives the service the ability to upgrade its systems at the pace of technology, Rugen said.

“Commanders will be able to rapidly update critical capabilities creating multiple dilemmas for our adversaries,” he said. “MOSA saves time and lowers future operations and support costs.”

During a panel discussion at the Association of the U.S. Army’s conference in Washington, Brig. Gen. Robert Barrie said the Army should look across programs and consider addressing common problems with shared solutions.

That could mean program managers accepting solutions that might not be exactly what their programs need, but are better for the Army as a whole.

Barrie said Army offices have in the past looked at their programs’ requirements individually and sought funding and solutions to fix problems with those programs on their own.

“In the end, we did a very good job of coming up with optimum solutions for each of our individual platforms,” Barrie said.

But this stovepiped process won’t work anymore, Barrie said, and the culture has to change.

“What we need to do [is] be willing to accept what in some cases may be a less-than-optimal solution for each platform in order for the whole to get a better solution,” Barrie said. “And for us to do that in an affordable way, and for us to do that at the pace of technology to keep up with our threats.”

Barrie said the aviation branch has looked at its past failures to learn from them. It came up with nine ongoing lines of effort involving policy, governance, structure, resourcing and others “to correct the sins of the past.”

The aviation branch has also set up a transformation office to subject spending to close scrutiny, Barrie said.

“Inside that office, we will make decisions on every single investment dollar that goes into the portfolio and run it through a lens to determine, is this the best use of this capability, and am I leveraging it to the greatest extent possible across the suite?” Barrie said.

Maj. Gen. Wally Rugen, the head of Army Future Vertical Lift modernization, said the modular open systems approach could help the Army afford to simultaneously pursue two future vertical lift aircraft -- the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft and the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft.

He pointed to a recent Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments report on the programs’ affordability, which found more investment in MOSA could boost competition and help keep costs down.

An F-15E Strike Eagle fighter jet with the 96th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, wrapped up a slate of assessments Oct. 7 when it dropped a GBU-72 Advanced 5K Penetrator bomb from 35,000 feet over the installation’s vast test range, the service said in a release Tuesday.

The Air Force first tried loading, flying and releasing the weapon — which is a BLU-138 penetrator warhead combined with a modified Joint Direct Attack Munition GPS guidance kit and tail assembly — in July. The three-part series of tests aimed to prove whether the F-15E could safely fire the bomb guided by a JDAM tail kit used on a lighter, 2,000-pound bomb.

Rather than letting a weapon rely on gravity to fall directly down onto a target, JDAM converts “dumb” bombs into GPS-guided munitions that can hit particular coordinates.

“In addition to the successful flight test series, the ground test series was Eglin’s largest-ever arena test, surpassing the previous titleholder by more than double,” the Air Force said. “The arena test, an open-air test where the warhead detonates surrounded by blast pressure sensors and fragment counting equipment, helps to determine the weapon’s lethality.”

The GBU-72 is designed to fly on fighter and bomber aircraft, though the Air Force hasn’t said which airframes could take on the new weapon other than the F-15E.

The Air Force has been researching the 5,000-pound weapon since at least 2017, and plans to begin buying them within the next year at a total cost of $36 million for 125 units, according to fiscal 2022 budget documents.

RELATED

It’s smaller than other bunker-busters that have grabbed headlines in recent years, like the nearly 22,000-pound Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb (or “Mother of All Bombs”) that hit an Islamic State cave and tunnel complex in Afghanistan in 2017, or the 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator weapon.

Still, the bomb is expected to cause significantly more damage against hardened, deeply buried targets compared to the GBU-28, which the GBU-72 will replace, Program Manager James Culliton said in the release. GBU-28 is a 4,000-pound penetration bomb that was created for destroying underground Iraqi command centers in the 1990s, according to the Federation of American Scientists.

Rather than going after terror groups in Southwest Asia, the weapon joins a stockpile that can also be wielded against countries whose political and military ambitions are kept under close watch.

“North Korea is one possible motivation — but underground nuclear production sites as much as bunkers, perhaps,” Michael O’Hanlon, foreign policy research director at the Brookings Institution, told Air Force Times. “Ditto in regard to Iran, another likely motivator.”

The new design boasts a smart electronic fuse that can activate at a preprogrammed location and be more durable and efficient — with fewer weapons needed to “achieve a kill” at lower cost — than other models, the Air Force said.

Air Force solicitations have indicated the service could eventually purchase as many as 2,000 of the bombs.

The 41st Expeditionary Electronic Combat Squadron formally shut down Sept. 28, marking another milestone in the U.S. military’s withdrawal from war against the Taliban and other insurgent forces in Afghanistan. The unit reverts back to the 41st Electronic Combat Squadron when not deployed.

The squadron and its specialized “Compass Call” planes headed to U.S. Central Command from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks. Since then, those EC-130H crews have flown about 14,750 sorties — more than 90,000 hours in the air.

RELATED

Compass Call’s unique mission has made it one of the most in-demand airframes in CENTCOM over the past 20 years. It carries a slew of hardware and software that allow airmen to eavesdrop on nearby combatants, interfere with enemy transmissions across radios and combat vehicles alike, jam radars and, in recent years, send computer code to wireless devices — regardless of whether they are connected to the internet.

Those capabilities have come in handy from the start but continue to evolve as the globe grows increasingly dependent on assured connectivity and trustworthy information from those networks.

“At the onset of Operation Iraqi Freedom, dozens of Iraqi soldiers waited patiently near the al Faw Peninsula for instructions being transmitted from higher headquarters to blow up key oil fields there. The message never came. In its place … was static,” the Air Force said of EC-130H operations in 2004, about two years into Compass Call’s time there.

EC-130H crews include about a dozen airmen onboard: two pilots, a navigator, a flight engineer, a mission crew commander and supervisor, a maintenance technician, a signals analyst and multiple cryptologic language analysts.

Their tactics have changed alongside frequent upgrades from the secretive “Big Safari” program office. Compass Call has pivoted to jam the signals of booby-trapped enemy quadcopters that are used for surveillance and bombings, and cut off contact between members of groups like the Islamic State.

As the military scrambled to evacuate Afghan and American citizens, and to pull out its own troops from Afghanistan in August, EC-130Hs flew overhead to ensure U.S. troops had the open lines of communication they needed. While the 41st EECS will no longer maintain a permanent presence in the UAE, Compass Call can still deploy on hacking and jamming missions in CENTCOM as needed.

The Air Force is also bringing the 41st EECS home in the process of replacing the Compass Call fleet, which outfitted existing C-130 planes with electronic warfare equipment four decades ago.

Five of 14 EC-130Hs have retired so far, and only half the fleet will remain as of next fall. They’re making way for the EC-37B, a smaller, modern jet intended to be more cost-efficient, reliable and faster than the current platform.

L3Harris, in charge of integrating the new suite of EW systems onto the jet, and Gulfstream, whose G550 airframe will serve as the new Compass Call itself, plan to deliver the first planes to the Air Force in 2023.

RELATED

Looking ahead, squadron members are practicing for conflicts that will keep them on their toes. Instead of relying on the same brick-and-mortar installation as its home base overseas, as it has for decades, the 41st EECS recently tried its hand at a rapid evacuation and relocation drill for the first time.

It’s part of the Air Force’s push to make units more flexible in case their installation is targeted, or to quickly leapfrog through a region during back-to-back sorties.

Handling missions across multiple geographic regions requires a particularly close relationship between aircrews and maintainers on the ground to keep the aging planes aloft, the Air Force said.

“We tried to make it as realistic as possible while ensuring both the flight crews and maintenance crew members were briefed and ready,” C-130H pilot Capt. Brittany Monio said in a December 2020 release. “Planning flights in such a quick manner is a large deviation from normal, but our crews executed very safely and effectively.”

The Ghostrider — the fourth generation and latest model of the Air Force’s AC-130 series of gunships — is already heavily armed with 30mm and 105mm cannons and AGM-176A Griffin missiles and has the ability to carry Hellfire missiles and GBU-39 small-diameter bombs.

But for years, the Air Force has been musing about the possibility of further arming the gunship with a laser.

Now-retired Lt. Gen. Bradley Heithold in 2015 floated the possibility of adding a laser — possibly in place of the 105mm cannon — that could first operate defensively to take down a missile coming for the gunship. Or, Heithold suggested, it could be used offensively, to disable enemy vehicles or aircraft without anyone seeing or hearing anything.

“This isn’t Star Wars stuff, folks,” Heithold, then head of Air Force Special Operations Command, said at an Air Force Association conference that year. “The technology is ripe for doing this. … I’ve got the space, I’ve got the weight, and I’ve got the power.”

However, getting a laser on the Ghostrider has taken longer than Heithold originally hoped. He told reporters at that 2015 conference he wanted a laser-armed AC-130 by the end of the decade.

In early 2019, Lockheed was awarded the contract to integrate, test and demonstrate the laser subsystem on the AC-130J.

“Completion of this milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for our customer,” Rick Cordaro, vice president of Lockheed Martin Advanced Product Solutions, said in the Oct. 6 release. “These mission success milestones are a testament of our partnership with the U.S. Air Force in rapidly achieving important advances in laser weapon system development. Our technology is ready for fielding today.”

Lockheed is also working on its airborne laser program for the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, under a $12 million contract awarded in July.

The Ghostrider is a significant upgrade over the older AC-130U Spooky gunships, boasting improved avionics, navigation systems and weapons. It reached initial operational capability in September 2017. The first squadron received a Ghostrider — the Block 20 version — in February 2018, and AFSOC got the more advanced Block 30 AC-130J the following year.

Hishammuddin Hussein replied to a question posed by lawmakers Sept. 30 that the six MD 530G helicopters will undergo another round of predelivery inspection at manufacturer MD Helicopters’ facility in Mesa, Arizona, in November.

This comes after a first round of inspections in June and July found “critical equipment and essential software” needed to be rectified prior to acceptance. The minister did not elaborate on the nature of these issues, but he said the long-delayed delivery of the helicopters could start if they pass the upcoming inspection.

The helicopters have also undergone type certification process by Malaysian aviation regulators, with Hishammuddin also confirming that all six helicopters are built and in flyable condition, and that Malaysian Army personnel already underwent training on the aircraft type in the U.S.

Pilots were trained in two separate groups between April and July, while ground crew also received technical training on the aircraft in two groups between May and August. The flight training took place on a range in western Texas that was leased by MD Helicopters, with the MD 530Gs carrying U.S. civil registration.

Malaysia ordered the MD 530Gs in 2016. Delivery was originally supposed to take place in two batches — the first two by July 2017, with the other four scheduled to arrive by December 2018. But delivery has repeatedly been pushed back over “technical” and other issues.

A delivery deadline was then set up by the end of 2020, but that timeline set by Malaysia’s Army chief, reported by Defense News last year, also slipped.

The MD 530Gs are fitted with a digital glass cockpit; a Tek Fusion mission management and weapons management system; ballistic armor protection; a crash-tolerant fuel system; a chin-mounted Wescam MX-10D electro-optical/infrared laser designation turret; and a Thales Scorpion helmet-mounted system to assist with a pilot’s situational awareness.

Malaysia opted to fit the helicopters with Belgian FN Herstal HMP400 50-caliber machine gun pods and seven-shot M260 pods for 70mm rockets. The helicopters will be based in the state of Sabah in eastern Malaysia, which has in recent years encountered security challenges related to ongoing insurgencies and general lawlessness in the southern Philippines.

Smuggling and piracy have also occasionally spilled over into the eastern Malaysian waters, along with gangs from the Philippines crossing the sea to raid Sabah’s popular beach resorts, sometimes kidnapping tourists for ransom."
45,https://www.defensenews.com/unmanned/2021/10/07/italy-drops-drone-program-instead-buying-piaggio-aircraft/,defense,"ROME — Italy announced it will purchase six new Piaggio Aerospace aircraft to help relaunch the Italian firm, and indicated the government is dropping long-held plans to buy drones from the company, ending the ill-fated story of the Hammerhead UAV.

The Italian Defence Ministry said it would spend €171 million (U.S. $198 million) to buy six P.180 Avanti Evo turboprop plane as well as a flight simulator and engine maintenance work.

The aircraft, which add to the ministry’s existing fleet of P.180s, will likely be used for transport, reconnaissance and special missions.

The purchase comes at a useful time for the firm, putting it on a sounder financial footing as it comes up for sale following a three-year spell in receivership.

“Fulfilling the Government’s commitment to supporting Piaggio Aerospace’s turnaround, this remarkable order further enhances the value of the Company, which is now close to finding a new owner,” said Piaggio Aerospace’s extraordinary commissioner, Vincenzo Nicastro.

The contract means Rome has made good on its commitment to hand over about €700 million in deals to get the firm back on its feet. A previous work order was worth €540 million.

Previous contracts included engine maintenance work on the Army’s CH-47 and A129 Mangusta helicopters as well as upgrades to operational P.180 aircraft.

However, a contract is missing — one the government said in 2019 it would award to Piaggio Aerospace.

At the time, Italy promised to purchase four of the firm’s P1.HH drones — the unmanned version of the P.180 planned by Piaggio and nicknamed the Hammerhead. The drone was originally on the United Arab Emirates’ shopping list after Piaggio was taken over in 2014 by Mubadala Development Company, an Abu Dhabi-based strategic investment firm.

The UAE wanted to buy the Hammerhead, and wanted Italy to buy a version. But when Italy dragged its heels on the purchase, the UAE walked away, canceling its orders and placing the firm in receivership in 2018, putting hundreds of jobs at Piaggio in jeopardy and leaving the firm with nearly completed P1.HH drones on its hands.

Hence, the decision by Italy to buy the drones in 2019, despite the Italian Air Force chief telling parliament he did not want them.

But three years on, it appears the government has decided it can avoid buying the drones ― effectively letting the program die ― if it simply switches to buying manned aircraft from the firm to make up its spending promise.

“The decision on drones will now be left to future investors,” an industry source told Defense News.

With an Italian-Swedish group of investors reportedly close to buying the firm with a view to building electric propulsion aircraft, military drones may not be high on the agenda, and the fate of Hammerhead may be sealed."
46,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/10/07/finland-tweaks-2022-budget-to-accommodate-hx-fighter-purchase/,defense,"HELSINKI — The Finnish government has approved an expansion to its defense procurement budget for 2022 that takes into account preliminary costs associated with the €10 billion (U.S. $12 billion) HX Fighter Program and the acquisition of new multirole aircraft.

The proposal for new budgetary measures was presented to Finland’s national parliament, the Eduskunta, on Sept. 27. It is now included in the preliminary defense budget for 2022.

Under the government spending plan, the armed forces’ procurement expenditure budget will rise to €2.37 billion. The government has so far authorized the spending of €9.46 billion to meet HX-FP acquisition costs.

About €144 million of the proposed increase in the military’s procurement budget relates to value-added taxes connected to the purchase of multirole fighters.

Logistics Command received final quotes from five manufacturers for the HX effort in April 2021, and they are currently under evaluation. Each contractor’s submission contained information on the inclusive solution and package tailored to each multirole fighter option.

The final quotes were received on five candidate aircraft: Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet, the Dassault Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 and the Saab Gripen.

The process is likely to run to the end of the third quarter of 2021, and the Defence Ministry is expected to ask the government to buy the aircraft by the end of the year.

The ongoing evaluation examines the scale of industrial cooperation offered by each manufacturer, including maintenance system solutions. On price, the military specified an offering, including operating and maintenance costs, must be affordable according to the existing defense budget.

In the last phase of the evaluation, the military will require candidate aircraft take part in a simulated, long-term war game to determine the operational efficiency of each candidate’s proffered HX system, including entire life-cycle costs.

The HX-FP is the military’s largest-ever procurement. The choice of aircraft will influence the force’s operational and combat capability well in to the 2060s.

Future defense procurement activities are expected to involve partners for cross-border weapons acquisition. In September, Finland reached an agreement with Sweden covering the procurement of soldiers’ weapons systems and linked technologies. The agreement sets down guidelines to manage joint procurement projects.

47,https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2021/10/05/air-force-pick-pledges-to-tackle-f-35-sustainment-costs-back-nuclear-modernization-plans/,defense,"WASHINGTON ― Bringing down sustainment costs for the Lockheed Martin-made F-35 Joint Strike Fighter would be a “top priority” for the nominee to lead U.S. Air Force’s acquisitions, he said Tuesday.

Andrew Hunter, a former director of the Pentagon’s Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell and President Joe Biden’s pick for assistant Air Force secretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, told senators he would work at the problem.

“The F-35 is an absolutely vital system for the nation and the challenges we confront with peer competitors we confront, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region,” Hunter said at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. “The cost of sustaining the F-35 has been something that has stressed the services, particularly the Air Force, which has the largest number of aircraft.”

In an exchange with the SASC ranking member, Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., Hunter acknowledged that buying more could be a way to lower operating costs per aircraft. But Hunter added that “there are other avenues we can and should take to lower the cost of the F-35,” though he did not elaborate.

If confirmed, Hunter would oversee an Air Force procurement budget of about $60 billion. Beyond the F-35, Hunter said he would work to lower Air Force sustainment costs more broadly ― which he agreed make up the lion’s share of life-cycle costs for most weapons systems.

“The Air Force has an aging fleet, and that has been driving up sustainment costs,” Hunter said during an exchange with SASC Chairman Jack Reed, D-R.I. “We have to make sure we bake in sustainability on the front end. So for the systems we have in development, we will look to make sure sustainability is considered early in the design to lower those costs over the long term.”

Lawmakers previously pressed Lockheed and the Pentagon to lower sustainment costs, saying those figures could force the Pentagon to cut the numbers of F-35s it plans to buy. Meanwhile, the Pentagon last month awarded Lockheed a $6.6 billion contract to sustain the F-35 from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023, which promises to reduce the cost of flying the aircraft by about 8 percent.

The House-passed version of the FY22 defense policy bill would require the Air Force, the Navy and the Marine Corps to meet targets for “cost per tail per year,” which measures the average cost of flying, maintaining and upgrading the jet.

New weapons

With the Pentagon’s current nuclear modernization track under competing pressures both internally and politically, Hunter affirmed the Air Force’s ongoing nuclear modernization programs would be among his top priorities.

“The timelines for delivering these new systems are very tight. Therefore we will be pursuing, if I am confirmed, these programs with urgency,” Hunter said during an exchange with the strategic forces subcommittee’s top Republican, Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska.

In written testimony, Hunter said he supports the Air Force’s Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program, which is set to replace the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, and the Long Range Standoff Weapon program, which aims to field a new air-launched cruise missile capable of both nuclear and conventional strikes.

Also at the hearing, both Hunter and the nominee for undersecretary of the Army, Gabriel Camarillo, defended Army plans to base long-range missiles in the Pacific against charges they were duplicative. Camarillo described the Army’s development of hypersonic weapons and its extended-range Precision Strike Missile as “very top priorities.”

Camarillo argued the Army’s long-range fires efforts respond to National Defense Strategy guidance, address threats from the Pacific and Europe, and would be able to “degrade the anti-access, area denial defense that we’re likely to face.”

Those comments on Tuesday came six months after the Air Force general in charge of managing the service’s bomber inventory made headlines for calling the Army effort expensive, duplicative and “stupid.”

48,https://www.defensenews.com/2021/09/30/turkey-wants-compensation-for-ouster-from-us-led-jet-program/,defense,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey intends to seek compensation for its removal from a U.S.-led stealth fighter jet program, possibly during a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden on the margins of a Group of 20 meeting next month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.

Erdogan, speaking to journalists during a flight back from a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, also said there would be no “turning back” from deal with Russia for Turkey’s acquisition of S-400 advanced missile defense systems. That deal led to NATO-member Turkey’s removal from the international program that produces F-35 fighter jets.

Erdogan said he hoped to meet Biden at the G-20 meeting in Rome to discuss the F-35 project, including a $1.4 billion payment Turkey had made before its ouster from the program. Another meeting between the Turkish and U.S. leaders could also take place on the sidelines of a November climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, Erdogan said.

“We made a $1.4 billion payment, what will become of that?” Erdogan said. “We did not - and do not - earn this money easily. Either they will give us our planes or they will give us the money.”

Asked about Turkey’s plans to purchase additional S-400 systems despite threats of further U.S. sanctions, Erdogan responded: “The S-400 process continues. There is no turning back.” His comments were reported by the private Turkish news channel NTV and other media.

Turkey was kicked out of the F-35 program and its defense officials were sanctioned after the country bought the Russian-made S-400 missile defense system two years ago. The U.S. strongly objects NATO members using the Russian system, saying it poses a security threat to the F-35s.

Turkey maintains the S-400′s components could be used independently without being integrated into NATO systems and therefore pose no risk.

The U.S. also sanctioned Turkey for its purchase under a 2017 law aimed at pushing back Russian influence. The move was the first time that the law, known as CAATSA, was used to penalize a U.S. ally.

Erdogan’s talks with Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi focused on steps that would deepen defense cooperation between Turkey and Russia, including partnerships for aircraft engines, fighter jets and submarines, the Turkish leader said.

Russia also could be involved in the construction of Turkey’s second and third nuclear power plants, and of a space launch platform, he said.

Erdogan traveled to Sochi to discuss the situation in Syria, where Turkey and Russia back opposing sides in the conflict. Russia is the main ally of the Syrian government, while Turkey supports groups that have fought to unseat Syrian President Bashar Assad.

Russian and Turkish troops have, however, cooperated in Syria’s northwestern Idlib province - the final holdout of rebel forces - and in seeking a political solution in the country.

Erdogan said he and Putin agreed to continue to work together toward restoring calm in Idlib."
49,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2021/09/29/boeing-gets-nod-to-start-building-germanys-p-8-anti-submarine-aircraft/,defense,"WASHINGTON — Boeing has inked a contract with the U.S. Navy to produce five P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance and anti-submarine aircraft destined for the German sea service, the company announced.

The Sept. 28 award marks the latest step in Germany’s quest for urgently needed replacements for its aging P-3C Orion planes. Officials have said the Poseidon aircraft fit Germany’s requirement of offering a mix of sensor capabilities and combat punch needed to target adversarial submarines in an increasingly sophisticated subsurface arms race.

Earlier this summer, German lawmakers approved the purchase in principle. On the table was a $1.1 billion quote from the U.S. government for five aircraft through the Foreign Military Sales channel. Adding taxes, training, spares and support would bring the total price tag to about €1.4 billion (U.S. $1.6 billion).

Germany is set to start receiving the new aircraft as of 2024, according to a Boeing statement.

“We’re pleased to have finalized this sale to Germany and to expand our footprint in-country by bringing the P-8A and its unique multi-mission capabilities to the German Navy,” Michael Hostetter, vice president at Boeing Defense, Space & Security in Germany, said in the statement.

Despite Germany finalizing its P-8 acquisition, a defense spokeswoman told Defense News that Berlin would stick to previous plans with France to jointly develop the Maritime Airborne Warfare System, an entirely new sub-hunting weapon slated to take flight around 2035.

French officials were miffed that Germany would buy new Poseidons for the intervening years, possibly decreasing Germany’s appetite to start another development relatively soon, French newspaper La Tribune reported earlier this summer, citing unnamed sources.

The French Armed Forces Ministry did not return an email requesting information about the government’s position in the matter. Paris has not conveyed information to that end to Berlin, either, the German defense spokeswoman told Defense News.

50,https://www.defensenews.com/global/asia-pacific/2021/09/29/china-preps-rollout-of-a-new-carrier-based-fighter-jet/,defense,"MELBOURNE, Australia – China will debut its next-generation, carrier-borne fighter jet later this year, according to the country’s main state-owned aerospace conglomerate and the chief designer of its current carrier-based fighter jet.

This comes as China has demonstrated a pair of its land-based J-20 stealth fighters powered by indigenous engines at the ongoing Zhuhai airshow.

Speaking at a press conference at the airshow, Sun Cong, the chief designer of the mainstay jet fighter of China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy, or PLAN, carrier air wings, said that “people should be able to see good news on the next-generation aircraft carrier-based fighter jet” later this year.

Sun led the design of the Shenyang J-15 Flying Shark. He said more will be revealed about the new program when the time is right, according to remarks carried by the nationalist tabloid Global Times.

Similarly, state-owned aerospace and defense conglomerate Aviation Industry Corporation of China, or AVIC, said on its account on Chinese social media app Weibo that a new carrier-borne aircraft would be revealed before the end of 2021, although it is not clear if it was making its own announcement or just echoing Sun’s remarks.

Neither Sun nor AVIC revealed more details about the program, although the social media post included a graphic showing what appeared to be a stealthy twin-tailed design under wraps.

It has been speculated in recent years that China is developing a new carrier-based fighter jet based on the Shenyang J-31 as the next-generation combat aircraft to equip China’s growing fleet of aircraft carriers.

China has two carriers in service and is building a third, significantly larger carrier. The first two ships are equipped with a ski-jump to assist aircraft in taking off, while the latest vessel being constructed in Shanghai will be equipped with catapults to launch heavier aircraft and conduct operations more quickly.

The J-31 is a twin-tailed, twin-engine, mid-wing design that incorporates some low-observable features and bears a passing resemblance to the Lockheed-Martin F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. It first flew in October 2012 and was present at the 2014 Zhuhai airshow.

Originally a private venture designed for the export market, the type found no takers among the group of countries that sought Chinese arms, however the design underwent a substantial rework and started flying again in 2016.

Like the J-15, the J-31 has so far only flown with imported Russian engines, although China has since made strides in its ongoing efforts to refine its own indigenous combat aircraft engine development efforts.

This is underscored by the stealthy Chengdu J-20 fighter powered by indigenous engines making its debut at this year’s Zhuhai airshow, with a pair of aircraft powered by WS-10C engines taking part in the daily flying display.

Both jets carried People’s Liberation Army Air Force, or PLAAF, national insignia, although neither carried five-digit PLAAF serial numbers.

These aircraft will join the increasing number of twin-engined Shenyang J-11s and J-16s, powered by the indigenous WS-10 since around 2011 or 2012. The single-engine Chengdu J-10, powered by the WS-10, has also started entering service with PLAAF units, replacing the Russian AL-31 turbofan engine after a protracted development cycle.

However, production examples of the carrier-borne J-15, which like the J-11 and J-16 have roots in the Russian Sukhoi Su-27/30 Flanker family of multirole fighter jets, continue to be powered by the Russian engine."
51,https://www.defensenews.com/global/the-americas/2021/09/28/could-britain-stop-argentina-from-buying-the-jf-17-warplane/,defense,"ISLAMABAD — Argentina insists reports the country is buying the JF-17 Thunder warplane are premature, but analysts believe it could still succeed where other fighter types failed — mostly as a result of British pressure.

Speculation arose after media reports highlighted a request in Argentina’s fiscal 2022 draft budget for $664 million to purchase 12 JF-17s from Pakistan.

However, Argentina’s embassy in Islamabad told Defense News that “no final decision has been made, as there are five alternatives currently being assessed.” When asked to identify those contenders, the embassy responded: “We don’t have any information on those alternatives.”

Andrei Serbin Pont, the director of Argentinean think tank CRIES and a former adviser at the country’s Strategic Affairs Secretariat, said there’s been a history of such speculation. Argentina has previously “included funds for acquisition of aircraft in the budget, but the aircraft were not acquired. This occurred with Mirage F-1Ms and with Kfirs (canceled last minute in 2015),” he explained.

He believes the JF-17 is an attractive choice for Argentina because the aircraft is “out of reach of possible U.K. vetoing of parts, and at the same time it is the only new aircraft within the budgetary restraints of the Argentine Air Force.”

RELATED

The U.K. previously pressured suppliers to cancel deals with Argentina, or sabotaged them by embargoing critical British components. Britain has effectively maintained an arms embargo on Argentina since the 1982 Falklands War.

Over the past decade, the country pressured Spain to scrap a deal to supply surplus Mirage F1M fighters, and a deal for Kfir jets from Israel appears to have failed due to a combination of British pressure and American control of the aircraft’s J79 engines.

Britain also effectively vetoed the sale to Argentina of Brazilian license-built Swedish Saab Gripen and Korea Aerospace Industries FA-50 aircraft. And the U.K. stopped the return to Argentinian service of ex-French Super Etendard Modernisé strike aircraft by refusing to provide export clearance for British components.

However, the JF-17 can operate with solely Chinese subsystems, effectively making it immune from British pressure.

Still, Serbin Pont said, “the United States is making a push offering used F-16s, and another alternative being put on the table are modernized F/A-18s.”

“Although Mirage and MiG aircraft are still under consideration, these are the least likely to be selected,” he added.

Brazil-based defense analyst Alex Galante believes while “the Argentine government has a preference for the JF-17,″ it might be “awaiting a better offer from the U.S. or Russia.”

Added aerospace expert Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute: “After other options have been repeatedly blocked or fallen through on finance grounds, the [JF-17] aircraft increasingly looks like the best option available.” But at this stage, he added, “any replacement fighter would be a potentially transformative boon for the Fuerza Aérea Argentina [Air Force] after more than a decade of unsuccessful attempts to replace its Mirage III and V fleets.”

Britain’s diplomatic post in Pakistan did not respond to Defense News about how the European country might react to a JF-17 sale, but aerospace expert Douglas Barrie, at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, suspects Britain is closely watching the procurement effort because of the aircraft’s weapons package.

“While the JF-17/FC-1 as a platform has only modest combat aircraft characteristics, some of the Chinese air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles that are being or are already integrated on the aircraft are capable, notably the PL-10 short-range IIR AAM and the PL-12 active-radar-guided AAM,” Barrie said. “The medium-range C-802 anti-ship missile has also been seen on development aircraft.”

But Bronk pointed out that the JF-17 has “limited range while carrying such weapons, especially in the context of Argentina’s extensive land and maritime territory.”

“It also remains to be seen whether the Fuerza Aérea Argentina would be able to sustain a decent serviceability rate with the JF-17, if delivered, as recent decades have not been kind to the FAA in this regard.”

Argentina’s Air Force has struggled to replace aging aircraft and maintain offensive capabilities, having retired nearly all its front-line combat aircraft, save for some A-4AR Fightinghawk attack aircraft now supported by an even smaller number of IA-63 Pampa jet trainers.

The fourth-generation JF-17 is jointly developed and produced by China’s Chengdu Aerospace Corp. and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, the latter of which produces 58 percent of the airframe and undertakes final assembly. The latest Block III variant, in production for Pakistan and being offered to Argentina, features a range of improvements, including an active electronically scanned array radar, plus the choice of a Chinese WS-13 engine rather than the Russian RD-93 that powered the first two variants and those in Pakistani service."

The last of the bombers, which have been in the Air Force since 1985, left Edwards Air Force Base, California, Thursday for the service’s aviation graveyard at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, Air Force Global Strike Command said in a release Friday.

RELATED

“The divestiture plan was executed very smoothly,” Brig. Gen. Kenyon Bell, AFGSC director of logistics and engineering, said in the release. “With fewer aircraft in the B-1 fleet, maintainers will be able to give more time and attention to each aircraft remaining in the fleet.”

B-1Bs can wield conventional weapons but not nuclear arms, and can carry the largest load of guided and unguided weapons of any Air Force aircraft. The 62-jet fleet is being phased out to make way for the dual-capable, stealthy B-21 Raider bomber now in production at Northrop Grumman.

Forty-five of the original 100 B-1Bs are still in use and are housed at Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota, and Dyess AFB, Texas. The Air Force retired about three dozen in the early 2000s and has lost several others in crashes. It received its first Lancer in 1985 and first deployed it in combat against Iraq in 1998.

But heavy use in U.S. Central Command for missions like close air support for ground troops — which the B-1 wasn’t built to do — came at a cost. Less than half of the Lancer fleet was combat-ready in 2019, for example, when only six bombers were available for regular operations.

“Continuous operations over the last 20 years have taken a toll on our B-1B fleet, and the aircraft we retired would have taken between $10 [million] and $30 million … per aircraft to get back to a status quo fleet in the short term until the B-21 comes online,” Global Strike said.

RELATED

Those issues have led to multiple stand-downs to address concerns like onboard fires and malfunctioning ejection seats. All Lancers are operational again after a fuel tank issue prompted a fleetwide grounding earlier this year, Air Force Global Strike Command spokesperson Lt. Col. Will Russell said. He did not answer how many planes needed repairs during the pause.

Of those that were retired starting in February, 13 headed to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group’s boneyard in Arizona. Four of the B-1s at Davis-Monthan can be restored to flight if the Air Force needs them.

Of the remaining four, one will help the service develop new structural maintenance methods at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma; one will be used for ground testing at Edwards; one will become part of a digital engineering project at the National Institute for Aviation Research in Kansas; and one will go on display at Global Strike headquarters at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana.

The Air Force is working toward a two-bomber inventory with the B-21, slated to start arriving in the mid-2020s, and the B-52H Stratofortresses that have been flying for six decades. It has not announced when it will begin to retire another group of B-1Bs or begin drawing down the B-2 Spirit fleet.

The tool, built by Kessel Run, a first of its kind software factory within the military, provided information regarding real-time, theaterwide awareness of logistics for the evacuation operation, allowing for more informed decision-making.

The Command and Control Incident Management Emergency Response Application, or C2IMERA, provides reporting, planning, force generation, emergency management, command-and-control monitoring, and execution. It uses customizable and optimized tools for a common operational picture and dashboard that consolidates information for enhanced command-and-control capabilities.

“The safe transit of more than 124,000 Americans and U.S. personnel, allies and partners, and Afghans at special risk from Kabul in the last two weeks of August was an extraordinary effort professionally carried out by AMC [Air Mobility Command] and AFCENT [Air Force Central Command], coalition, and joint force Airmen,” said Lt. Gen. Greg Guillot, who leads Ninth Air Force and is the head of U.S. Central Command’s air component. “Kessel Run’s C2IMERA application served as a reliable, adaptable tool as we planned and executed this complex, historic operation.”

The evacuations from Afghanistan look place as the U.S. withdrew its forces from and the Taliban took control of the country. The Air Force said it and industry partners were able to rapidly update C2IMERA in a four-day period to understand the rapidly changing environment to meet real-world needs.

That capability is critical to the Air Force and the Defense Department, which has been trying to adopt commercial best practices and realize the power of bringing modern software capabilities to its sometimes antiquated and industrial-age procedures and platforms.

“Prior to the capability request, AFCENT [U.S. Air Forces Central] and their installations were relying on typical manual processes like excel spreadsheets — which works in many cases — but is inefficient and does not provide ability for distributed access, data aggregation, or visualization capabilities,” said Capt. Maurice Morrell, program manager for the C2IMERA Team with Kessel Run. “Kessel Run’s C2IMERA team was able to modernize and update the software for theater and installation systems, providing an effective tactical to operational C2 bridge, as the operation was happening in real time.”

During the evacuation, a U.S. Air Forces Central Command location experienced an incident that affected a base’s flying operations, a service release said. The Combined Air and Space Operations Center used C2IMERA to receive automated alerts of the incident and response. This provided an additional level of coordination in near-real time, going beyond the manual reporting process, which saved response time and labor hours.

C2IMERA is now mandated for use across all Air Combat Command installations and is currently used at more than 40 Air Force installations.

China’s People’s Liberation Army flew fighter jets toward Taiwan twice on Thursday, once in the morning with 19 planes, and once in the afternoon with five more. Taiwan deployed air patrol forces in response to the Chinese jets and tracked them on its air defense systems, the island’s Defense Ministry said in a statement.

The jets the morning flight, some of which flew in a long L-shaped path, were 12 J-16 and two J-11s, as well as bombers and an anti-submarine aircraft. Later in the day, China sent 2 J-16 and J-11 planes as well as an early warning aircraft.

Taiwan and China split during a civil war in 1949, but China continues to claim Taiwan as part of its territory. Beijing opposes Taiwan’s involvement in international bodies.

Taiwan announce Thursday that it applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, setting up another potential clash with Beijing.

China’s military sent 18 planes towards Taiwan last year when a top U.S. diplomat visited the island and met with top government officials. In June, it sent 28 warplanes after leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations issued a statement calling for a peaceful resolution of cross-Taiwan Strait issues."
55,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/09/22/air-forces-top-civilian-hints-at-changes-to-hypersonic-weapons-programs/,defense,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — The U.S. Air Force’s top civilian is unsatisfied with existing hypersonic weapons programs and isn’t sure whether the weapons under development will meet the service’s needs, he said on Monday.

Although the Air Force’s work on hypersonic weapons is progressing, it’s not moving fast enough, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall told reporters at the Air Force Association’s Air, Space and Cyber conference.

On top of that, the service has not laid out in enough detail which missions will call for the use of hypersonic weapons, how to fit them into operations and whether the technologies in development will allow the service to accomplish its goals, he said.

“It’s pretty clear to me what the Chinese want to do with the hypersonics they’re developing. It’s even pretty clear to me what the Russians might want to do with hypersonics,” Kendall said.

“The target set that we would want to address, and why hypersonics are the most cost effective weapons for the U.S., I think it’s still to me somewhat of a question mark,” he added. “I haven’t seen all the analysis that’s been done to justify the current program.”

Air Combat Command head Gen. Mark Kelly agreed more work needs to be done to ensure the hypersonic weapons being developed can be incorporated into normal operations.

“I think he’s right. We do need to make sure we have an unambiguous, well-understood [concept of operations] we go forward to,” he said Wednesday. “We need to make sure that, before we pull the trigger and commit a ton of resources to it, everyone’s on the same piece of music.”

While Kendall did not criticize a specific program, the service’s AGM-183 Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon has encountered several flight test failures over the past year and — as the first hypersonic missile set to become operational — is the Air Force’s most visible hypersonic weapons program.

Most recently, during a July 28 test over Point Mugu Sea Range near southern California, the missile’s engine failed to ignite after the weapon was launched from a B-52 bomber.

The Air Force hasn’t yet isolated the root cause of that failed test, said Brig. Gen. Health Collins, the Air Force’s program executive for weapons, during a webinar hosted by Defense News on Monday.

However, as long as the program is able to fix the issue and resume flight testing by the end of 2021, the program will stay on track to put ARRW into production in fiscal 2022, he said.

“I will caveat, though, that depends on the root cause being found and in us getting back into flight this year,” Collins said, adding that other failures could further impact the schedule.

Although Kendall is scrutinizing the Air Force’s hypersonic programs, he has not slowed down either ARRW or the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, said Lt. Gen. Duke Richardson, the service’s top uniformed acquisition official.

“Secretary Kendall has not spared any program,” he said Tuesday. “He’s doing exactly what you would expect the secretary of the Air Force to do — he’s coming in with some questions. I think he’s seeing the fiscal environment and he wants to make sure that we’re focused on the war fighter.”

Charles “CQ” Brown’s directive to airmen to “accelerate change or lose” is gaining momentum after a year in practice, but the work to revamp the service’s culture has only just begun.

The Air Force’s top officer announced his overarching vision for a more flexible and capable force upon starting the job in August 2020. Four months later, he unveiled a set of directives intended to spur change in four areas over the next few years: empowering airmen; shrinking bureaucracy; global competition, and future force design.

“Some things are going better than others,” Brown said during a roundtable with reporters at the Air Force Association’s annual conference here Monday. “Part of this is the culture change as much as it is the ‘A, B, C, D’ [action orders], which will take some time.”

Brown has pushed for troops to learn a broader set of skills than what’s in their job description, regardless of their specialty; for high-level commanders to trust their subordinates to do what’s right for their units; for a deeper understanding of the United States’ military and economic tensions with Russia and China; and to cut outdated and unaffordable aircraft from the inventory, among other goals.

RELATED

The Air Force outlined its progress in a press release earlier this year, noting that Brown’s directive had spurred airmen to tackle projects like diversifying recruitment efforts, overhauling cyber warfare training and better connecting airmen with support services for their kids.

“Airmen at Air University’s Chief Master Sergeant Leadership Academy at Maxwell AFB, Alabama … designed a Command Senior Enlisted Leadership course in collaboration with their Estonian military counterparts,” the Air Force added. That course, planned for this month, “will help senior enlisted leaders gain a greater understanding of the needs of all nations bordering the Baltic Sea, and how the U.S. and allies can work to amplify their collective strengths against competition in the region.”

One of the slowest-moving efforts is aimed at slashing bureaucratic red tape. If the Air Force was competing with the notoriously slow-moving Office of the Secretary of Defense for the most bureaucracy, Secretary Frank Kendall quipped, “I don’t know that [OSD] would win.”

As part of those endeavors, the service found it has several dozen governance bodies that are trying to make decisions to move the Air Force forward but often end up cancelling each other out. It also acknowledged that senior leaders are sometimes too far removed and don’t always have the information that they need to make sound decisions.

Brown indicated the Air Force could abolish certain working groups and other governing organizations that add “more time than value.”

Still, that doesn’t mean officials should go it alone. Brown recalled feeling disconnected from decisions made in the Pentagon when he was serving as the Pacific Air Forces commander nearly 5,000 miles away in Hawaii.

The solution to moving faster as a team is to start debate on issues earlier in the decision-making process rather than wait until a conversation reaches the top generals, and to keep leaders in the loop on changes made at lower levels without getting them involved, he said.

He’s still plenty aware of the power a four-star can wield in resolving sticking points that may arise.

“I bring members of the staff into my conference room and go, ‘We’re going to sit down and talk about this,’ because otherwise they’ll staff it amongst themselves, keep me out of the loop, and I probably could actually help them one way or another by either making a decision or providing direction,” Brown said.

Moving forward, Kendall has suggested that the service review its work once a year to ensure the efforts are still helpful and on the right track. Shepherding those along will be a key focus of Brown’s second year in the seat, the general said.

To keep tabs on the sweeping, multiyear strategy, Brown regularly meets with the officers in charge of bringing each action order to fruition.

“I sit down with them, spend an hour with them, to ask them questions: Where are the roadblocks? Where can I help?” he said. “Let me know how it’s going, so we can break down some of the barriers that may be implied because they misconstrued my intent or come up with their own ideas.”

The Department of the Air Force’s new civilian leaders hope to make their mark on future planning soon: Undersecretary Gina Ortiz Jones is exploring ways to streamline the department as it has grown to encompass both the Air Force and the Space Force, to make sure each service has clear lines of authority and accountability.

“I think what’s been extremely important is the secretary’s vision about working as a department and making sure that every effort we’ve got reflects certainly the Air Force’s equities as well as the Space Force’s equities … given not only what they do for the Air Force, but for the joint force,” Jones said.

When Kendall came into the top civilian job, the department already had studies and wargaming underway to explore the right mix of fighters, bombers and other assets it wants for its future squadrons. The secretary told Air Force Times in August that he wants to launch further data-driven analyses to see where the Air Force and Space Force are falling short on personnel, ops and policy.

Brown urged airmen to take matters into their own hands rather than wait for leadership to act.

“We could all use more manpower, more money and more time. But leaders cannot wait for perfect conditions to act or make a decision, because perfect conditions will never exist,” he told the force on Monday. “What if you received no additional manpower or resources, but were empowered to prioritize what was important and were relieved of constraints? I challenge all of us to start thinking this way, because we are in a zero-sum game situation.”

57,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/09/21/us-air-force-to-declare-winner-of-b-52-engine-replacement-competition-as-soon-as-this-month/,defense,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — A contract award for new engines for the venerable B-52 bomber is “imminent” and could occur as early as this month, the U.S. Air Force’s top acquisition officials said Tuesday.

The service is set to decide whether General Electric, Rolls-Royce or Pratt & Whitney will produce modified commercial engines to outfit the B-52, which is set to fly through at least 2050.

“We’re starting to wrap that work up. It shouldn’t be much longer,” said Lt. Gen. Duke Richardson, the Air Force’s top uniformed officer for acquisition.

Darlene Costello, the service’s acting acquisition executive, said the source selection team is completing its work and the service could be ready to announce a winner “probably within the month.”

“It could be faster, but they have to do their due diligence, and I’m not going to get in their way,” she said. “I will not step in until they’ve completed their work.”

The Air Force operates 74 B-52s, each outfitted with eight TF33 engines. The service plans to order 592 new engines, plus spares and support, from the winner of the B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program.

The service released a solicitation to industry in May 2020 that initially projected a contract award in June 2021.

Pratt & Whitney, the incumbent manufacturer of the B-52′s TF33 engine, has proposed its PW800. GE Aviation offered the CF34-10 and Passport engines, and Rolls-Royce put forward its F130 engine for the competition.

In the first phase of the program, the service chose to use a contracting mechanism called mid-tier acquisition authority, which allows it to accelerate prototyping new technologies while reducing certain regulatory requirements. Richardson said it has helped to save time in the front end of the effort.

At some point, Costello said, the Air Force will determine whether to continue the effort as a traditional program of record or continue using mid-tier authorities to prototype elements of the new engines.

To expedite engine development, the companies created digital prototypes of its engines that were able to be plugged into a virtual model of the B-52. Richardson said he expects that work will “save us quite a bit of time going forward.”

JIADONG, Taiwan — The F-16 screeched across the sky Wednesday before landing on a highway cut through pineapple fields in southwestern Taiwan to refuel quickly and take off again.

The Taiwanese military exercise envisioned a Chinese attack taking out the island’s main airfields, necessitating the use of rural roads as runways to carry on the fight.

War is not imminent, but as China has grown increasingly assertive in both the East China and South China Seas, Taiwan is stepping up its defense. Across the region, the United States and its allies are deepening military cooperation and strategizing over an effective response.

China, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory, flies fighter jets toward Taiwan on a regular basis in an effort to warn and intimidate the island’s air force. Last month, Chinese fighter jets, anti-submarine aircraft and combat ships conducted joint assault drills near Taiwan with China saying the exercise was necessary to safeguard its sovereignty.

U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a meeting next week with key regional players that form the so-called “Quad” — India, Australia and Japan together with the U.S. — for in-person talks the White House said are meant to show the administration’s commitment to “promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific.”

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian slammed the U.S. for “forming exclusive cliques” after the meeting was announced and countered that China was a “firm defender of regional peace and stability.”

“China’s development is a growing force for peace in the world and a boon to the prosperity and development of the region,” he said. “The countries concerned should abandon the outdated zero-sum mentality and narrow-minded geopolitical thinking.”

Japan, a U.S. ally that hosts the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet, has long moved cautiously with regard to China, an important trading partner. But it has recently become less reserved in the face of Beijing’s growing military activity and broad territorial claims in the western Pacific, including to a group of islands near Taiwan that Japan controls.

Masahisa Sato, a senior lawmaker of the governing Liberal Democratic Party and an expert on defense, told a recent forum on security in Asia that right now the U.S.-Japan alliance is focused largely on a response to a possible conflict stemming from the Korean Peninsula, and it needs to be broadened to consider what to do if there is a Chinese attack on Taiwan.

He noted that the Sakishima island group, which includes some of Okinawa’s remote islands, “is right next to Taiwan and is part of a same theater.”

“We should consider a Taiwan contingency as nearly equal to a Japan contingency,” Sato said.

All three candidates running on Sept. 29 to become Japan’s new leader are proposing hawkish policies toward China, though still acknowledging its importance as a trading partner.

Taro Kono, the minister in charge of vaccinations who is seen as a front runner, has said he will seek to establish a regional framework that adds to Japan’s alliance with the United States in countering China’s growing military activity.

In a joint statement after they met in April, outgoing Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Biden said they “recognize the importance of deterrence to maintain peace and stability in the region” and added that they “oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea” and reiterated their “objections to China’s unlawful maritime claims and activities in the South China Sea.”

Underscoring its concerns, Japan’s Defense Ministry added a new section on Taiwan in its annual report released in July, saying the situation requires a “sense of crisis.” It says China’s military capability has become far greater than that of Taiwan and that Japan must pay attention to further increases on both sides.

Suga announced he will not run in the Sept. 29 Liberal Democratic Party leadership vote, which chooses a new party leader who will become Japan’s next prime minister.

Taiwan has stepped up purchases from the U.S. of weapons including missiles and aircraft over the past two years.

Taiwan’s defense ministry submitted a budget of $16.8 billion for the next year, a modest increase from last year’s $16.2 billion. Some of the funds would purchase 66 F-16V fighter jets, according to the semiofficial Central News Agency.

Many believe, however, that despite the bellicose rhetoric and drills like the Han Guang exercise on Wednesday, as well as the Chinese posturing, that open conflict is not on the horizon.

“This is a type of gray zone tactic — military intimidation,” said Ou Xifu, a researcher at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taiwan. “This shouldn’t lead to war.”

59,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/09/14/lockheed-nabs-f-35-sustainment-contract-worth-up-to-66b/,defense,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Monday awarded Lockheed Martin a contract worth up to $6.6 billion to sustain the F-35 joint strike fighter from fiscal 2021 to 2023, a deal that will reduce the cost of flying the aircraft by about 8 percent.

The agreement funds the sustainment of the F-35 air system for U.S. and international customers during FY21, with options for FY22 and FY23 that would bring the contract’s total value to $6.6 billion.

During that time, the average cost per flight hour for all F-35 variants will drop from $36,100 in 2020 to $33,400 in 2023, according to a Defense Department statement. For the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing model — the most prevalent variant of the aircraft, used by the U.S. Air Force and most international customers — the cost per flight hour will go from $33,600 in 2020 to $30,000 in 2023.

Lockheed’s share of the cost per flying hour would decrease by more than 30 percent from the 2020 contract, said Bridget Lauderdale, Lockheed’s vice president for the F-35 program.

The deal will also drive improvements in full mission capable rates and supply metrics, the department stated.

“Working together with our industry partner, the F-35 joint program office team negotiated aggressive cost savings and performance targets that will benefit the global F-35 sustainment enterprise, and all F-35 customers,” said Lt. Gen. Eric Fick, who leads the F-35 joint program office on behalf of the Pentagon. “This ‘21-’23 sustainment contract agreement is a positive step in securing affordable lifecycle costs for our customers.”

The contract covers “on-site support of day-to-day operations from LM field service representatives, engineers, and Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) administrators, along with global enterprise support for sustaining engineering, supply chain, repair and replenishment material, and training,” according to the program office.

However, it does not include the cost of sustaining the jet’s F135 engine, which is negotiated in a separate contract with manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.

Importantly, both the program office and Lockheed Martin stated that the deal “lays the groundwork” for a future performance-based logistics contract, which the company has sought over the past few years.

In 2019, Lockheed proposed a performance-based logistics contract it claimed would result in $1 billion in savings for the department, but the Pentagon rejected the offer. Fick in 2020 said the department was still working to “crisply articulate [its] desired role” in sustaining the jet and didn’t want to get locked into a deal that wouldn’t meet its requirements.

Lockheed presented a scaled-down version of the proposal to the Pentagon earlier this year. That offer centered around ensuring the availability of spare parts and accelerating repair times and would have run from 2022 to 2026.

However, some lawmakers are skeptical a performance-based logistics contract will produce the intended results.

The House Armed Services Committee’s version of the FY22 defense authorization bill includes language that would prohibit the Defense Department from entering into such a deal for the F-35 program unless the defense secretary certifies that the program meets cost reduction metrics and that sustainment costs would further decrease under the terms of the agreement.

The total investment announced by the MoD Sept 12 comes to some £400 million ($550 million), with the bulk of the spending plans going towards software and hardware upgrades of the Royal Air Force’s eight-strong fleet of C-17 strategic airlifters.

In a second pre-DSEI contract announcement involving the MoD, BAE Systems said it had secured a deal valued at more than £220 million ($300 million) to deliver advanced synthetic training for pilots flying the Typhoon combat jet.

The £324 million ($450 million) C-17 spending package will include enhancements to the beyond-line-of-sight, satellite-enabled communication equipment; a wider field of view via the head-up display to enable increased pilot situational awareness; and widening the scope of the current free-fall parachuting capability.

The five-and-a-half-year deal continues the support arrangements for the aircraft under a scheme where nine C-17 operating nations have access to a common support solution, including items like spares, design services, and maintenance enhancement as part of a contract with the U.S. Air Force.

Mid-year the British announced the extension of a synthetic training services deal with Boeing to undertake C-17 aircrew and engineering training support in the UK. Boeing has been providing the training capability under the arrangement for the British since 2014.

The future of the RAF’s C-17 fleet had been the subject of speculation ahead of the publication of the British government’s Integrated Review on defense, security and foreign policy, published earlier this year.

In the event the MoD opted to axe earlier than planned the fleet of Hercules C-130J tactical airlifters it uses mainly for special forces missions. That’s a decision that drew sharp criticism here, most recently due to its performance during the evacuation from Afghanistan.

The C-17, which celebrated 20 years service with the RAF earlier in 2021, also played a key role in the evacuation.

Alongside the C-17 upgrade the MoD also announced it was installing infra-red suppression systems (IRSS) on some of the British Chinook Mk 5 and Mk6 fleets as part of a £64 million improvement program.

The IRSS will enhance defensive systems capabilities against threats posed by new missile systems targeting the aircrafts’ infra-red signature.

In a statement announcing the deal with Boeing Defence UK, the MoD said: “IRSS technology will counter with ‘blanking plates’ on the helicopters, which mask the hot components and redirect airflow to cool the exhaust gases, making it more difficult to target.”

Minister for Defence Procurement Jeremy Quin said: “Whether evacuating people in Kabul, transporting people to hospital during Covid-19 or providing crucial logistics on the battlefield, the C-17 and Chinook provide an invaluable service to our Armed Forces across the globe.”

“This investment ensures our aircraft are equipped with cutting-edge technology to face a myriad of emerging threats from adversaries,” said Quin.

In May this year Britain announced it was buying 14 new, extended-range Chinooks in a £1.4 billion ($2 billion) deal with deliveries extending over a decade.

The Integrated Review said Britain would be standing down some of its older Chinooks but did not give firm numbers or a timetable for the move.

The deal with BAE to lead work on the Typhoon Future Synthetic Training program will involve the delivery of 10 high-fidelity, immersive simulators together with state-of-the-art training facilities at the RAF Typhoon bases at Coningsby and Lossiemouth.

The contract award follows two previous deals with BAE over the last 18 months as part of the program.

BAE said in a statement Sept. 13 that the target initial operating capability is set for RAF Coningsby in late 2022."
61,https://www.defensenews.com/global/asia-pacific/2021/09/09/indian-government-approves-order-request-for-56-c295-aircraft/,defense,"NEW DELHI — The Indian government on Wednesday approved a procurement request for 56 C295 transport aircraft from Airbus Defence and Space in Spain, under which 40 military planes will be manufactured in India by local firm Tata Group.

The approval was granted Sept. 8 by the Indian government’s apex armament clearance body, the Cabinet Committee on Security, which is led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This is the first project of its kind in which a military aircraft will be manufactured in India under technology transfer by a private company, according to Ministry of Defence release.

A $2.5 billion contract is to be signed with Airbus next month, under which the original equipment manufacturer will directly supply 16 military aircraft, and the remaining 40 will be manufactured in India by Tata Group subsidiary Tata Advanced Systems Limited, or TASL, said an MoD official.

A separate $500 million contract is to be signed later with TASL for performance-based life cycle product support of the Indian Air Force’s C295 fleet, he added.

“The project will augment domestic aviation manufacturing resulting in reduced import dependence and expected increase in exports,” the MoD release read.

The MoD had issued a global tender for 56 military transport aircraft in May 2013, and only Airbus Defence and Space submitted a bid, with potential competitor Antonov Design Bureau of Ukraine pulling out at the last minute due to Russian sanctions that interrupted its supply chain.

All 56 C295 aircraft will be inducted into the Air Force within the next 10 years. They are meant to replace 59 obsolete Avro HS 748 aircraft manufactured by state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, a service official said.

The C295 procurement was delayed by more than three years over price negotiations, the localization on Indian-made aircraft, offsets and performance-based logistics issues.

“All issues have been settled now,” the MoD official said.

A senior executive at TASL, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the individual was not authorized to speak to the media, said the company will establish a dedicated maintenance, repair, and operations and manufacturing facility in Bangalore, southern India, in the next two years. He refused to share further details.

Airbus executives in New Delhi would not comment for this story.

62,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2021/11/18/eu-nations-add-air-space-and-drone-tech-to-their-defense-cooperation-roster/,defense,"WASHINGTON — European Union defense ministers this week approved new collaborative projects meant to boost the bloc’s military capabilities in air, space and drone operations.

The fourth wave of 14 initiatives boosts the slate of Permanent Structured Cooperation projects to 60 since late 2017. Collectively, they represent a key component of EU defense aspirations, though fielding any usable equipment as a result is still years away.

A new Strategic Air Transport for Outsized Cargo project aims to field a common aircraft fleet for long-haul cargo flights, filling a perennial shortage among European NATO members. The project, which is open for “possible third-state participation,” counts Germany, the Czech Republic, France, the Netherlands and Slovenia as its members.

The reference to so-called third states is a hint to non-EU countries — likely the United Kingdom or Norway — that they could play a role in the effort if they want. The idea is to identify a “common European solution for the transport of outsized cargo” by 2023, with a separate, follow-on project in 2026 to work toward actual equipment, according to a fact sheet published online by the European Defence Agency.

Estonia, France and Latvia are banding together on a “semi-autonomous” and optionally manned naval vessel that could be used for reconnaissance, hunting submarines and surface ships, and laying mines. For this project, initial capabilities are already drafted, and companies are looking for ways to form a consortium, according to the EDA statement.

A “next-generation” small drone sporting a weight of 150 kilograms is the aim of another new project, which aims to deliver an initial prototype by 2026. The craft is meant to be runway-independent, highly deployable, multirole and “tactical,” though official statements leave open what exactly that means.

Germany, as one of the project members besides Spain, Portugal and Slovenia, has been reluctant to admit the use of armed drones for its forces, though the incoming government has reportedly indicated their use could be permissible under strict self-defense conditions.

Under the banner “Defense of Space Assets,” six nations will endeavor to inject survivability considerations into the space programs of EU members states, as satellites vital for military operations on Earth are increasingly becoming targets for would-be adversaries.

The project entails a “three-step approach combining training for space military operations, space resilience and access to space and in-space maneuverability,” the EDA statement read. France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Austria are listed as project members so far.

Aside from approving new initiatives, officials this week also adopted recommendations aimed at monitoring progress in the PESCO projects, according to the European Council website. Critics previously lamented the slow pace in some lines of work, warning that the bloc needs to more quickly catch up in the effort to muster new military capabilities without American help.

The arrangement allows UAE military customers to receive aviation MRO services under a cost-per-flight-hour model.

To fulfil this agreement, GAL signed another contract with a separate Edge subsidiary, AMMROC, to perform the maintenance at the latter’s Al Ain facility, which was first unveiled at the 2019 Dubai Airshow. The facility, which is a single square kilometer and is directly connected to the Al Ain International Airport, features a 36,500-square-meter hangar space with five hangars. The facility is able to support more than 35 different fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft types.

“Since its unveiling, Al Ain facility was expected to get major regional maintenance contracts from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and the region, but it has not inked any major contract yet,” an industrial source with knowledge of the matter told Defense News on the condition of anonymity.

Under the subcontract, AMMROC will help perform aircraft, engine and component depot-level maintenance services.

In July 2020, Edge had entered into a conditional agreement to acquire the remaining 40 percent stake of AMMROC that was held by Lockheed Martin. The source denied any relation between the Lockheed deal and the latest contracts involving GAL and AMMROC.

The head of AMMROC, Hareb Al Dhaheri, said in a statement that the subcontract “goes a long way in adding value for our customers through reducing turnaround times and ensuring best-in-class, localised solutions.”

In an interview with the AMMROC executive prior to this year’s air show, Al Dhaheri told Defense News that ever since if delivered its first C-130H from the Al Ain facility in September 2020 following MRO services, the company has performed maintenance for at least six C-130 aircraft in its hangars.

“Other aircraft inducted for heavy checks include CN-235 and A330 MRTT. In addition to aircraft heavy checks, we also have been providing components and engine overhauls and repairs for multiple aircraft types, both fixed and rotary wing,” he said at the time.

64,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2021/11/17/british-air-force-hails-first-ever-test-flight-using-only-synthetic-fuel/,defense,"LONDON – Britain’s Royal Air Force has taken a landmark step towards slashing carbon emissions from its aircraft, announcing Nov. 17 that the service had completed the world’s first flight using 100 percent synthetic fuel together with commercial partner Zero Petroleum.

Using the company’s UL91 fuel the flight of the Ikarus C42 microlight plane from Cotswold Airport on Nov. 2 lasted 21 minutes.

The successful voyage by senior RAF test pilot Group Captain Peter Hackett has been logged by Guinness World Records as a world first for an aircraft using only synthetic fuel.

The initiative, part of a wider effort to reduce carbon emissions known as Project Martin, is partly funded by the RAF. Work on the role of synthetic fuels in reducing RAF emissions is being led by the air service’s Rapid Capabilities Office.

In a statement the MoD said the technology “has the potential to save 80-90% of carbon per flight, supporting the RAF’s vision that synthetic fuels will have a major role in powering the fast jets of the future.”

The RAF has previously signaled its intention to start replacing petroleum-based fuels on aircraft later this decade.

The replacement of 90 piston-powered Grob Aircraft T1 Tutor elementary flying trainers could be one of the first aircraft to be carbon emission free.

Zero Petroleum is a small British company founded by the hugely successful Formula One racing engineer Paddy Lowe and Nilay Shah, head of chemical engineering at Imperial College London.

Lowe said the aviation fuel, known as ZERO SynAvGas, was “developed in five months and ran successfully in the aircraft as a whole-blend without any modification to the aircraft or the engine.

“The engine manufacturer Rotax’s measurements and the test pilot’s observations showed no difference in power or general performance compared to standard fossil fuel,” said the Zero Petroleum chief executive.

The fuel is manufactured by extracting hydrogen from water and carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide. Using energy generated from renewable sources like wind or solar, these are combined to create the synthetic fuel.

Zero Petroleum and its technology partner IGTL designed and built a production plant in record time in Peterhead, Scotland.

The plant was then positioned at Billia Croo, in the Orkney Islands, for fuel manufacturing operations during September and October.

British Defence Procurement Minister Jeremy Quin said the development illustrated the military’s determination to pursue “net zero” alongside meeting operational commitments.

“Whilst green technologies like electric and hydrogen power generation are viable for many RAF platforms, high-performance aircraft require a liquid fuel alternative, like the UL91, to maintain operational capabilities,” he said.

“This is the first innovation of many, with a range of research and development activities underway to consider the viability of synthetic fuels without compromising aircraft performance,” Quin added.

The RAF plans to have its first net zero emissions airbase by 2025, and has set a goal of a net zero force by 2040.

Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal Sir Mike Wigston is due to make a keynote speech in London Nov. 23 detailing the air service’s plans to achieve net zero emissions."
65,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/11/17/got-cruise-missile-armed-cargo-planes-the-us-air-force-is-nearly-there/,defense,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force conducted a test of its Rapid Dragon palletized munition system concept Nov. 3, which could one day pave the way to launching a barrage of cruise missiles out of the back of mobility aircraft.

The Air Force Research Laboratory said in a Tuesday release that it deployed a long-range cruise missile separation test vehicle — basically a cruise missile without its engine or warhead — from an MC-130J Commando II aircraft.

During the flight demonstration at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the MC-130′s crew — an operational group from Air Force Special Operations Command — obtained new targeting data for its onboard battle management system while it was flying to the drop zone, the release said. The battle management system then uploaded that new data to the weapon on the pallet, allowing it to find its new target.

This was the first time the battle management system, using a beyond line-of-sight command-and-control node, received and uploaded new targeting data into such a separation test vehicle, the Air Force said. The service’s previous beyond line-of-sight retargeting demonstrations had used a cruise missile emulator.

When the MC-130J neared the target, it airdropped the Rapid Dragon deployment system carrying the unarmed cruise missile, as well as three weights each simulating the mass and shape of cruise missiles. Within a few seconds, parachutes deployed to stabilize the pallet, and the cruise missile and the weights began to release sequentially to avoid collisions. The missile’s wings and tail popped out, it began to pull up, and then it glided toward its new target.

AFRL said this could lead to the first deployment of a live long-range cruise missile, operating under powered flight, from an MC-130J flown by Air Force Special Operations Command. And future programs following up on this effort will look at whether Rapid Dragon can handle other types of weapons and multiple effects capabilities.

“In future conflict scenarios against strategic competitors, the ability to cost-effectively deliver long-range standoff weapons en masse from nontraditional platforms expands warfighting flexibility and introduces new deterrence options,” Rapid Dragon program manager Dean Evans said.

AFRL spokesman Bryan Ripple said the next test will be a live-fire event, expected to take place in December.

The Air Force Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation Office is leading the Rapid Dragon program. The other organizations that took part in the demonstration were the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren, the Standoff Munitions Application Center, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, System Technologies, and the Safran Electronics and Defense subsidiary Parachutes USA.

AFRL said in the release that the demonstration also showed previous successful tests could be replicated, such as conducting high-altitude airdrops, jettisoning multiple weapons from Rapid Dragon, and deconflicting weapons during their release by cleanly separating the unarmed cruise missile and the three other simulated missiles.

And AFRL said Rapid Dragon would be able to easily roll on and off of mobility aircraft without any modifications to the planes.

Once parachutes stabilized the falling palletized munition deployment system, the cruise missile and three weights were released sequentially. This photo shows the successful separation of the cruise missile following the weapon release, followed by the deployment of its wings and tail. (U.S. Air Force)

The Air Force has been looking for ways to arm its airlift planes with multiple weapons strapped to smart pallets, which could upload targeting information to the weapons. This “bomb bay in a box” concept, as the Air Force once termed it, is intended to allow aircraft such as the C-130 and C-17 to release several weapons that could strike enemies from a distance, while itself staying out of danger.

But while the Rapid Dragon program could represent an advancement in the way the Air Force launches palletized munitions from mobility aircraft, it would not be the first time weapons were delivered from those planes. In 2017, an MC-130 from a special operations unit at Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico dropped a GBU-43/B known as the MOAB, or Massive Ordnance Air Blast, on a tunnel complex in Nangarhar, Afghanistan, used by the Islamic State Khorasan militant group.

In the first quarter of FY22, the economy grew 20.1 per cent. For the FY22, the RBI has estimated real to be at 9.5 per cent — 7.9 per cent in Q2, 6.8 per cent in Q3, and 6.1 per cent in Q4.

“According to SBI’s Nowcasting Model, the forecasted for Q2FY22 would be 8.1 per cent, with an upward bias. The full-year (FY22) GDP growth is now revised upwards to 9.3-9.6 per cent, from our earlier estimate of 8.5-9 per cent,” the research report, Ecowrap, said.

The projected 8.1 per cent growth rate in Q2FY22 is the highest growth across all economies, it said. The average GDP growth of 28 selected economies has decelerated to 4.5 per cent in Q3 (2021), against 12.1 per cent. Also at an annual rate of 9.3-9.6 per cent, the country’s real GDP growth would now be 1.5-1.7 per cent higher than the pre-pandemic level of FY20.

On November 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the government would repeal the three farm laws. He also said a committee would be set up to decide on matters, including promotion of zero-budget farming, scientifically changing the crop pattern, keeping in mind the changing requirements of the country and make MSP more effective and transparent.

The report also said five agricultural reforms could act as enablers, even without these Bills.

“First, instead of MSP as a price guarantee that farmers are demanding, the government could insert a quantity guarantee clause for a minimum period of five years that procurement to production percentage of crops (being currently procured) should at least be equal to last year percentage,” the report said.

US Trade Representative Katherine Tai, who is on a two-day visit to India, said she hoped to make progress in areas such as movements of goods and services between the two countries, and ironing out market access restrictions and high tariffs, and these would be taken up on priority with India.

“I believe that a revived TPF can help our trade relationship keep pace with other important aspects of the US-India partnership … at USTR we hear very frequently from our stakeholders who are not shy on issues that will be familiar to those of you involved in moving goods and services between our two countries, market access restrictions, high tariffs, unpredictable regulatory requirements, restricted digital trade measures. These are issues where we intend to make progress and they will be on the top of my list while I’m here,” Tai said after meeting Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal.

“I’m also looking forward to discussing how further collaboration on what we are calling worker-centric policies can benefit our trade relationship. President Biden and I are convinced that US trade policy requires a fundamental shift to ensure that our policies and actions focus on the impact that trade and trade agreements have on real working people,” she said.

Established in 2005, the India-US TPF met last in October 2017. It was then replaced by negotiations between the two sides on a trade deal. With the Biden administration now insisting on resolving irritants first rather than going for a mini deal, the focus on the TPF has again emerged.

“The trade relationship between our two countries is a top priority, both from President Biden and for me. That’s why it was important for me to come to India and relaunch the trade policy forum on my first trip to Asia,” she said.

Goyal said the Trade Policy Forum was only the beginning of a new chapter in trade relations between the two nations and he hoped to revitalise the platform and resolve outstanding issues.

“I hope our meetings will encourage business communities and investors on both sides to look at a greater degree of engagement,” Goyal said."

The government had decided in February 2019 that National Oil Companies (NOCs) would be free to choose field specific models including farm out and Joint Venture (JV)/ Technical Service Model (TSM) for enhancing production from their mature and ageing fields, the ministry said.

""The government is keen that the domestic production of oil and gas should increase exponentially. ONGC, being the leading organisation, has to play an important role. While on one side, area under exploration has to be increased which would subsequently lead to more new discoveries in the country. On the other side, production from existing fields has also to be optimised and increased wherever possible by employing advanced technology, drilling more production wells, wherever technically feasible, and better management.

""For this private sector companies can be involved as partners or through various business models so that new techniques and technology can be brought in through such companies which have experience in this. However, all this has to be done by following system and procedures in a transparent manner. has to prepare its plan and take right decisions in order to increase domestic production.

The government in August enacted a law to end all retrospective taxation imposed on indirect transfer of Indian assets. The rules under the law seek to withdraw tax demands made using a 2012 retrospective legislation to tax the indirect transfer of Indian assets and also refund the amount paid in these cases without any interest.

Talking to PTI, Bajaj said of the 17 companies against whom demand was raised, barring three or four entities, all have given an undertaking to the government to resolve the cases.

""All of them have approached. There were 17 cases, out of which 3/4 had no trace. We had also sent the order in email, we never got a response. The remaining 14, baring 1 odd, who still has time to file, the remaining has filed... Cairn, Earlyguard have come (for settlement),"" he said.

With regard to Vodafone, Bajaj said the UK-telecom company has time till month end to file for settlement. ""For some the change (in tax laws) was made through the I-T Act, for some the change was made through the Finance Act.""



The company for whom changes were made through Finance Act has time till end of the month to file for settlement, he added.

On October 1, the Finance Ministry had notified rules which prescribed that companies will have to withdraw any pending litigation or proceeding before any forum against the levy of the and also give an assurance that they won't pursue any further claims in the future.

In addition, the companies and any other interested party were required to furnish an indemnity bond committing not to seek damage from the Indian government or its affiliates.

Later on October 13, the Ministry notified a fresh set of rules to facilitate settlement of the retrospective tax dispute with British telecom giant Vodafone Plc.

The 'Relaxation of Validation (Section 119 of the Finance Act, 2012) Rules, 2021', prescribed the forms and conditions for the declaration to be filed by the company for settling its case.

Vodafone had 45 days to approach the government for a settlement.

The case pertaining to Vodafone is different as taxes were sought from the company by validating an October 2010 order of the I-T department that sought Rs 11,218 crore in taxes from the British firm over its 2007 acquisition of Hutch-Essar through a deal in the Cayman Islands.

The Supreme Court had in January 2012 quashed the tax demand but the same was sought to be revalidated through Section 119 in the Finance Act, 2012. A penalty of Rs 7,900 crore was also sought from Vodafone.

Asked how soon the disputes would be resolved, Bajaj said ""Cairn is working on it... now the ball is in their court. As soon as they take the cases back, we will give them the cheque. In those cases where there is no money to be refunded, settlement there would be faster.""



The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, enacted in August scraps the tax rule that gave the tax department power to go 50 years back and slap capital gains levies wherever ownership had changed hands overseas but business assets were in India.

The 2012 legislation was used to levy a cumulative of Rs 1.10 lakh crore of tax on 17 entities, including Vodafone, but substantial punitive action was taken only in the case of Cairn.

Last week PTI had reported that Cairn Energy PLC had earlier this month given required undertakings indemnifying the Indian government against future claims as well as agreeing to drop any legal proceedings anywhere in the world.

The government has now accepted this and issued Cairn a so-called Form-II, committing to refund the tax collected to enforce the retrospective tax demand, two sources with direct knowledge of the development said.

Following the issuance of Form-II, Cairn will now start withdrawing all cases in international courts. Once this is complete, the company will be issued a Rs 7,900 crore refund.

With the ground-breaking and foundation-laying ceremony for the Noida International Airport scheduled on November 25, the state is now on way to having five international -- the highest for any state in India.

In perspective, the state had only two international since 2012 when Varanasi got this distinction after Lucknow. The international airport at Kushinagar became operational after it was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 20, 2021, while work on the international airport in Ayodhya is on full swing and air services are expected to start early next year. The fifth international airport is to come up at Jewar near Noida in the National Capital Region (NCR).

At present, has 8 operational airports, while 13 and 7 airstrips are being developed. The operational airports handling commercial flights in are Lucknow, Varanasi, Kushinagar, Gorakhpur, Agra, Kanpur, Prayagraj and Hindon (Ghaziabad).

The unique distinction of Uttar Pradesh in providing unmatched air connectivity in the country is in keeping with the Government's commitment to ensure uninterrupted multi-modal connectivity on land, railways, water and air. The ambitious Prime Minister's GatiShakti National Master Plan has infused a sense of urgency into the plans for infrastructure development in the state.

The Noida International Airport (NIA) being constructed near the town of Jewar in Gautam Buddh Nagar in the NCR region in Uttar Pradesh will be India's largest airport after its completion. Its location is about 72 km from the existing IGI airport in New Delhi, 40 km from Noida and about 40 km from the multi-modal logistics hub at Dadri.

It will have excellent multi-modal connectivity as it is close to the existing Yamuna Expressway (Greater Noida to Agra), close to Eastern Peripheral Expressway and it will have link with Delhi-Mumbai Expressway at Ballabhgarh, Khurja-Jewar NH 91, link to dedicated freight corridor, Metro Extension from Noida to NIA and link with the proposed High Speed Rail (Delhi-Varanasi) at airport terminal.

* The phase I of the airport will have a capacity to serve 12 million passengers a year and is scheduled to be completed in 36 months.

* In each phase, the airport will expand to serve 70 million passengers by the end of phase 4, subject to passenger growth and traffic.

The Kushinagar airport inaugurated by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 20 is located 47 km from Gorakhpur. Kushinagar is an important place for Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world as it is believed that Gautam Buddha had attained Nirvana here more than 2,500 years ago. It provides connectivity to many places of Buddhist pilgrimage such as Lumbini in Rupandehi District of Nepal; Sarnath in Varanasi, Shravasti near Bahraich, and Bodhgaya, Rajgir and Vaishali in Bihar.

The air connectivity of both eastern and western Uttar Pradesh will improve manifold with the Kushinagar airport and proposed NIA.

It will truly be a momentous achievement for a state that is on way to be a leader in the nation's march towards progress.

In its report 'Brick by Brick- Long term capital to fund for all', Knight Frank cited the latest United Nations' data, more than 57 per cent (4.5 billion) of the world's population (7.9 billion) is living in urban areas as of year 2021.

""Twenty-nine per cent (1.3 billion) of this urban population is living in substandard housing, which translates into a need gap of 325 million urban houses. In India, 35 per cent of urban population is living in substandard housing, which translates to a need gap of 35 million houses, which is 11 per cent of the world's housing need gap,"" Knight Frank said.

Out of the 3.5 crore homes, there is a need of two crore homes for the economically weaker section (EWS), 1.4 crore the lower-income group (LIG) and 10,00,000 in the lower middle class category.

The consultant said the total area required to be constructed for 3.5 crore homes is 1,658 crore square feet, considering EWS as 30 square metre, LIG square metre, lower middle class 100 square metre.

Knight Frank estimated the total investment at Rs 34.56 lakh crore, considering a construction cost of Rs 1,765 per square feet, LIG Rs 2,230 per square feet, and lower middle class Rs 2,787 per square feet.

The consultant said that additional Rs 10.36 lakh crore will be required for land and other approvals, taking the total investment requirement of Rs 44.92 lakh crore or USD 0.62 trillion.

""India's offers USD 0.62 trillion of funding opportunities for private funds in the backdrop of the government's push for this segment,"" Knight Frank said.

The consultant further highlighted that the affordable housing sector in India has witnessed private equity (PE) investments to the tune of USD 2,597 million since 2011.

The investment in the affordable housing has been 17 per cent of the total PE investment in the residential segment in India in the past 10 years (since 2011).

However, Knight Frank said it is yet to become a major theme for the funds in the country with a few private equity funds dedicated to funding affordable homes.

The report estimated that by the year 2030, more than 40 per cent of the Indian population will live in urban India as against the current figure of 35 per cent, which will create additional demand for affordable units with huge investment opportunities for private equity players.

Gulam Zia, senior executive director (research, advisory, infrastructure and valuation) of Knight Frank India, said: ""The PE investments into affordable homes have increased since the introduction of reforms in the sector. The presence of a few large funds dedicated to financing the affordable housing projects signifies the potential of the segment.""



However, he said, ""A significant portion of this investment into affordable housing segments is in projects for the mid-income segment and very little has been invested in constructing of the EWS and LIG segments, where the actual housing shortfall is.""



Commenting on the report, Suren Goel, partner at Fraidabad-based RPS Group, said the margins are less for developers in the affordable housing segment and large investors.

""The government is pushing the sector and offering several incentives. Yet, the private equity players are missing from the affordable segment because the profits are low and not attractive enough,"" he said.

Rohit Poddar, managing director of Poddar Housing and Development Ltd, said the affordable housing industry is one of the most critical segments in the sector in India.

""The government is also trying to address the issue of housing shortage in India by supplying affordable homes under 'Housing for All' funding for affordable housing is critical for the success of this flagship scheme of the government,"" he added.

According to Crisil Ratings, the demand growth in and combined will likely decline to 1.5 per cent annually this decade, compared with 4.9 per cent in the last.

“The trend will also be persuaded by policy interventions as India targets net zero emissions by 2070. Taking cue, oil refiners would be altering their production mix in favour of alternatives such as petrochemicals, which should also support their profitability,” the ratings agency said in a statement.

Crisil said that its analysis shows government initiatives to control emissions will impact the transportation sector on three major counts this decade.

“Through fiscal 2025, aggressive adoption of and ethanol blending will help slow down growth in demand for Beyond that year, there will be further flattening as electric vehicles (EV) hit the road rapidly.” Crisil said.

These initiatives will displace a significant portion of and petrol sales in coming years.

“Diesel consumption will log a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 4 per cent between fiscals 2022 and 2025, but slow to approximately 2.5 per cent between fiscals 2025 and 2030, given continuous penetration of vehicles. The brakes will slam harder on petrol sales, slowing it from an already low CAGR of about 2 per cent between fiscals 2022 and 2025 to a mere 1 per cent CAGR between fiscals 2025 and 2030,” Crisil said.

Commenting on the prospects for oil refining companies, CRISIL said, “The 40-60 million tonne per annum (MTPA) of capacity addition lined up by refiners—over and above approximately 110 MT that will come on-stream by fiscal 2030 — may need to be trimmed as these may not be needed,”

“Even excluding these 40-60 MTPA capacities, we see utilisation of refiners remaining below 100 per cent through most of this decade for the first time in years,” the CRISIL report added.

The Domestic demand for petrol (excluding ethanol) is expected to grow a mere 2 per cent between financial year 2021-22 and 2024-25.

Between fiscals 2020 and 2025, it is expected to be flattish at 28.8-29 MTPA. Over the next three years, 28-30 MT of domestic sales is expected to be displaced.

“Of this, 16-18 MT will be because of ethanol blending, 9-11 MT due to and 1-2 MT by EVs,” CRISIL said.

“As EV penetration gains momentum post fiscal 2025, largely led by the two-wheeler segment, the fuel displacement is likely to get sharper. We expect a total loss of 70-72 MTPA between fiscals 2026 and 2030 — 46 per cent attributable to ethanol blending, 34 per cent to CNG, and 20 per cent to EVs,” the Crisil report added."

The changed rates will come into effect from January 1, 2022. This will help the MMF segment grow and emerge as a big job provider in the country, said Ministry of Textiles.

""The Textiles & Apparel (T&A) industry was having long pending (first under sales tax then, under VAT and finally under regime) demand for removal of inverted tax structure on manmade fibre (MMF) value chain. The on MMF, MMF Yarn and MMF Fabrics were 18%, 12% and 5% respectively. The taxation of inputs at higher rates than finished products created build up of credits and cascading costs. It further led to accumulation of taxes at various stages of MMF value chain and blockage of crucial working capital for the industry.

""Though there is a provision in law to claim the unutilised Input Tax Credit (ITC) as a refund, but there were other complications and resulted more compliance burden. The inverted tax structure caused effective increase in rate of taxation of the sector. The world textiles trade has been moving towards MMF but India was not able to take advantage of the trend as its MMF segment was throttled by inverted tax regime,"" the ministry further said.

This 12% uniform GST rate is likely to contribute positively to the growth of the sector in the following ways:

i) The uniform rate of 12% for entire value chain of MMF textiles sector will be benefiting and save lot of working capital. It will reduce the compliance burden of the industry players. This is a welcome step by the Government with no inversion.

ii) The uniformity of GST rates will be helpful to resolve the ITC residues that accumulated due to the inverted tax structure earlier.

iii) The uniformity in the GST rates shall 12% GST on job work related to dying and printing services will benefit the industry to absorb and recover unutilised ITC.

iv) The significant portion of MMF products (output) is expected to be exported, it will lend a better scope for encashing the untilised ITC. Also since tax on input will get refunded, on output (export) which will be zero rated, it would not add to cost and make exports competitive.

v) Uniform 12% GST will help the industry having huge portion of piled up opening ITC by enabling them to encash the same progressively

""Differential rates for garment creates problem in compliance of tax regime. MMF garment cannot be identified easily and cannot be taxed differently, hence there is need for uniform rate. Uniform rate makes it simple and since there is so much high potential of value addition in garment segment that the increase in rate is likely to be absorbed in value addition. It will provide clarity to the industry and settle, once and for all, the issues caused by inverted tax structure,"" the ministry said."

The international rating agency had last week kept the sovereign rating unchanged at 'BBB-' with a negative outlook, and said that the risks to India's medium-term growth outlook are narrowing with rapid economic recovery from the pandemic and easing financial sector pressures.

In an email interview with PTI, Ratings Director (Asia-Pacific Sovereigns) Jeremy Zook said the two key positive triggers that could lead to a revision of the outlook to stable are implementation of a credible medium-term fiscal strategy to lower debt burden and higher medium-term investment and growth rates without the creation of macroeconomic imbalances, such as from successful structural reform implementation and a healthier financial sector.

""We forecast that the central government will achieve a deficit of 6.6 per cent of GDP in the current fiscal year, largely as a result of stronger-than-expected revenue buoyancy. Our forecasts assume that the government does fall short of its budget target for divestment,"" Zook said.

In the 2021-22 (April-March) Budget presented on February 1, the government had pegged the fiscal deficit, or gap between the Centre's expenditure and revenue, at 6.8 per cent of GDP or Rs 15.06 lakh crore.

At the end of September, which is six months in the financial year, the touched 35 per cent of budget estimates.

Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj has said the government's tax collection kitty will surpass budget estimates this financial year on the back of good direct and indirect tax mop-up.

""After refunds also, we have touched almost Rs 6 lakh crore till October in direct taxes... It is looking good. Hopefully, we should exceed it.

""Though we have given a lot of relief in indirect taxes in petrol, diesel and edible oil, also there are some sunsets that have come in customs duty where the total benefit would be about Rs 75,000-80,000 crore. But, still, I think we should exceed the budgeted estimates on both direct and indirect taxes,"" Bajaj told PTI.

With regard to disinvestment, as against the budgeted target of Rs 1.75 lakh crore, the mop-up so far stands at Rs 9,330 crore.

Asked when expects a reversal in India's rating outlook to stable, Zook said, ""We do not have a specific timetable for resolving the negative outlook which could result in a rating downgrade or stabilisation of the outlook at the current rating level. We normally aim to resolve such outlooks within a two-year time horizon, but it can take longer. We seek to review India's sovereign rating twice annually.""



India's general government debt rose to 89.6 per cent of GDP in FY21. Fitch forecasts the ratio to decline slightly to 89 per cent, still well above the 60.3 per cent 'BBB' median in 2021. The debt ratio should fall to 86.9 per cent by FY26 (ending March 2026) as per the rating agency.

""The two key positive triggers could lead to a revision of the outlook to stable. First, implementation of a credible medium-term fiscal strategy to bring post-pandemic general government debt down toward 'BBB' category peers levels.

""Second, higher medium-term investment and growth rates without the creation of macroeconomic imbalances, such as from successful structural reform implementation and a healthier financial sector,"" Zook added.

Zook also said the forthcoming reviews will assess these triggers.

""Conversely, negative triggers could result in a downgrade, namely, failure to put the general government debt-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory or a structurally weaker real GDP growth outlook, for instance, due to continued financial-sector weakness or reform implementation that is lacking,"" Zook added.

""The reason for the upward revision is that India recorded only 11% increase in Covid cases during Q3 2021, second lowest among top 15 most affected countries, and the increase in cases has declined to 2.3% in November 2021 over September 2021. So far, 1.15 billion vaccine doses have been administered, with 81% of the eligible population receiving at least a single dose and 42% of the eligible population both doses. In certain states including Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana and Madhya Pradesh more than 50% of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated,"" stated the report authored by Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, State Bank of India. The report was released on Monday.

India’s projected 8.1% growth rate in Q2FY22) is the highest growth across all economies. The average growth of 28 selected economies has decelerated to 4.5% in Q3 (2021) as against 12.1%. Also at an annual rate of 9.3-9.6%, India’s real growth would now be 1.5%-1.7% higher than the pre-pandemic level of FY20.

Meanwhile, on Friday, PM has announced to repeal all the three agriculture laws and will complete the constitutional process in the upcoming winter session of Parliament. PM has also announced to form a committee to decide, among others, making the system of MSP more effective and transparent.

SBI Research suggest 5 key agricultural reforms that could act as enablers even without these bills.

First, instead of MSP as a price guarantee that farmers are demanding, the Government mayensure a quantity guarantee clause for a minimum period of 5 years that make its mandatory of procurement to production percentage of crops

(being currently procured) being at least equal to last year percentage (with safeguards in exceptional events like droughts, floods etc).

Second, converting the Minimum Support Price to Floor Price of Auction on National Agriculture Market (eNAM). However, this will not completely solve the problem as the current data shows that average modal prices in e-NAM mandis is lower

than the MSP in all kharif commodities (except Soyabean).

Third, efforts must also continue to strengthen APMC market infrastructure. As per our estimates which are based on a government report, the monetary loss for cereals is almost Rs 27,000 crore due to harvest and post-harvest losses. The losses for oilseeds and pulses are Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore, respectively.

Fourth, establish a Contract Farming Institution in India that will have the exclusive right to oversee price discovery in Contract Farming. Contract farming has been instrumental in many countries by providing growers access to supply chains with market and price stability, as well as technical assistance. The experience of Thailand shows market certainty (52%) and price stability (46%)

were prime factors due to which farmers participated in contract farming.

Fifth, ensuring a symmetric procurement across states. The procurement of cereals had continued to be asymmetric, with top producing states in paddy like West Bengal (First) and Uttar Pradesh (Second) witnessing minimal procurement, even as states like Punjab and Haryana that are not largest producers witnessing much larger procurement."

Shah is an official distributor for Britain's Reckitt Benckiser in Vita, near Sangli city, around 200 miles south of Mumbai. But he said once-loyal customers now point to an app-- Partner--on their smartphones showing prices up to 15% lower, instead of placing orders.

""As Reckitt's distributor, I used to be like a prince in the market,"" said Shah. ""Now the buyer tells me, 'See how much you've been ripping us off!'""

The 31-year-old said he lost $2,000 of his own money as he discounted products to match prices on JioMart, the app rolled out by Reliance Industries billionaire Mukesh Ambani in his drive to revolutionise retail distribution in India.

Up and down India in places like small town Vita, the mom-and-pop stores that account for four-fifths of a near-$900 billion retail market--more than $700 billion--are increasingly turning to to stock up on foreign and domestic brands.

Just as Ambani, India's richest man, has disrupted the country's telecoms industry, the tycoon is intent on shaking up retail distribution, taking on U.S. e-commerce giants like Amazon (AMZN.O) and Walmart Inc (WMT.N), expanding fast in India.

The country has around 450,000 traditional distributors, who have legions of salespeople to service every corner of the vast nation, including 600,000 villages. They typically earn a margin of 3-5% on product prices and mostly take orders physically once a week, making deliveries to retailers within a couple of days.

But Reliance's model throws a wrench in that supply chain: the mom-and-pop stores, known as 'kiranas', can order goods on Partner with deliveries promised within 24 hours. Reliance also offers training on ordering, credit facilities and free product samples for affiliated kiranas' customers.

That means hundreds of thousands of salesmen representing consumer giants like Reckitt, Unilever (ULVR.L) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N), face an existential threat to their business, according to interviews with salespeople, 20 distributors and a trader group with members across India.

Many of the distributors contacted by Reuters said they have slashed their workforce or vehicle fleet, seeing their sales from door-to-door agents drop 20-25% in the last year as shopkeepers partner with Reliance.

In Vita, salesman Shah said he has had to lay off half of his staff of four. He fears the 50-year-old family firm might not last beyond the next six months.

'Guerrilla tactics'

The scale and speed of the disruption have triggered tensions between traditional distributors and Reliance that have boiled over into physical confrontation in some cases.

In Maharashtra state in the west - home to Vita - and Tamil Nadu in south, traditional salesmen have organised blockades of some JioMart delivery vehicles.

""We will employ guerrilla tactics,"" said Dhairyashil Patil, president of the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation, which represents 400,000 agents of local and foreign consumer firms. ""We will continue to agitate,"" he told Reuters, ""we want (consumer goods) companies to realise our value.""

Reliance remains undeterred in pushing ahead with Ambani's ""new commerce"" retail venture, first announced in 2018.

Last year it raised funds from marquee investors including Silver Lake Partners and KKR & Co Inc (KKR.N) as it seeks to integrate mom-and-pop stores in what it has touted as a more inclusive approach to digital commerce. That push is widely seen countering the likes of Amazon, which have for years faced - and denied - claims in India of favouring select big sellers at the expense of smaller retailers.

A source close to Reliance said the company was determined to keep expanding its business for mom-and-pop stores. It believes its model can co-exist alongside the traditional approach in one of the world's biggest retail markets, the person said, declining to be identified because of lack of authority to disclose company plans.

Ambani in 2018 said he eventually wanted to connect 30 million small merchants to the Reliance network. So far, it has 300,000 merchant partners in 150 cities who order consumer goods from Reliance, but the transformation will be magnified many times over if it meets a target of adding 10 million partner stores by 2024.

Reliance did not respond to requests for comment for this article.

Colgate declined to comment, while Reckitt said its customers and distributors were an integral part of its business but it does not comment on its relationship with them. Unilever's India arm, Hindustan Unilever, (HLL.NS) did not respond to a request for comment.

Which channel?

The traditional distribution methods remain important to the consumer goods makers, even amid the disruption, industry watchers say.

Himanshu Bajaj, former Asia consumer and retail head at consulting firm Kearney, said CEOs of consumer firms he met in September raised concerns about Reliance's strategy upsetting the traditional distribution chain.

""The companies don't want to kill their own distributors. The worry is real,"" he said.

Asked about Reliance's model and concerns among distributors, Sunil D'Souza, CEO of India's Tata Consumer Products (TACN.NS), told Reuters in an interview last month it ""can't afford to sit back and ignore"" any major distribution channel, but Tata was trying to minimise conflict and strike a balance.

Jefferies in March estimated kiranas will ""steadily increase the share of procurement"" from Reliance ""at the cost of traditional distributors"". Such sales for Reliance could mushroom to $10.4 billion by 2025 from just $200 million in 2021-22, Jefferies estimates.

One executive who works for a rival to Reliance said Ambani ""was spreading his wings very fast"" in servicing kiranas and already has an edge on negotiating prices, due to long-standing relationships with consumer good makers which have for years counted Reliance and its 1,100 supermarkets as a big client.

With kirana partners, Ambani is adding another, major vertical. ""Brands cannot afford to sideline Reliance, it's just their sheer purchasing power,"" said the executive, who declined to be identified as he wasn't authorised to speak with media.

All about pricing

Many kiranas are cramped shops in ageing buildings, where branded products are placed on wooden shelves and small sachets dangle from the ceiling. Such retailers are embracing Reliance as a means to boost profit margins.

When Reuters accompanied Anuruddh Mishra, a sales agent for Colgate, during a field trip in Mumbai's Dharavi area, he struggled to convince Shivkumar Singh, the 50-year-old owner of a dilapidated store, to make purchases. Dharavi is home to 1 million people and rated one of the world's biggest slums.

Singh opened his JioMart app and showed the far lower prices on offer. ""How can I order from traditional distributors?"" he said. ""The difference in price is huge. Now I order mostly from Reliance.""

A Reuters review of purchase deals on the JioMart Partner app showed the Dharavi retailer could bulk buy a two-tube combo of Colgate MaxFresh toothpaste for about 115 rupees ($1.55). Salesman Mishra's distribution company gets it for 145 rupees, and his last offer to the Dharavi retailer was 154 rupees - still more than a third higher than the Reliance price.

Back in Sangli, traditional distributors said they have at times chased down Reliance vehicles and confronted drivers, alleging unauthorised deliveries.

Sunil Pujari, who works in the city for one JioMart delivery agent, said he had been warned by his supervisors to immediately alert them if angry distributors stopped vehicles.

But business remains brisk.

""Prices offered by JioMart cannot be matched by anyone,"" he said, making another delivery in a crowded market."
16,https://www.business-standard.com/podcast/economy-policy/repeal-of-farm-laws-a-setback-or-a-step-in-the-right-direction-121112200091_1.html,economics,"In a surprise announcement on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government would repeal three controversial agriculture laws after 358 days of non-stop protests by farmer groups mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. The decision came on the occasion of Gurpurab and a few months ahead of the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, the hotbed of the agitation. The Bills were passed in September last year in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by voice vote and farmers have alleged ever since that the laws were made to help big businesses. Since then, the government’s 11 rounds of discussion with farmer leaders did not yield any meaningful results. So, what are these three contentious laws that triggered India’s longest ever farm protests? The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act gave an additional option for farmers and traders to sell and buy outside the designated mandis.

States and commission agents feared loss of revenue if farm trade moved out of mandis, whereas farmers feared this might have eventually led to the end of the MSP-based procurement system. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act provided a framework for contract farming. Farmer organisations said the was framed to suit big corporations and would weaken the negotiating power of farmers. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act removed stockhold­ing limits on certain agri-commodities except during extraordinary situations. The Opposition said the amendment would have benefited the hoarders, letting them dictate the terms, while at the same time hurting farmers and consumers. Now that we understand the basic outline of the laws, let’s delve into the implications of their repeal. While the protesting farmers might celebrate, a section of experts views this development as a setback for the farm sector. Despite the general consensus that the agriculture sector is sorely in need of reforms, not all experts are of the view that the three farm Acts would have been the right solution. This also might not be the death knell for agricultural reforms that certain sections believe it to be. After the repeal of the agriculture Acts, government officials told Business Standard that the focus would now shift to convincing the states to adopt the model APMC laws, which were promulgated some years back. However, this doesn’t mean that the Centre is off the hook as far as the protesting farmers are concerned. On Friday, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said that the protest would be withdrawn only after the three contentious legislations were repealed in Parliament and legal guarantee on minimum support price, or MSP, for crops made. The demand for MSP as a legal right could pose a huge challenge for the government. Whatever your opinion might be about the farm laws, one thing is undeniable -- for now, the central government has lost the narrative on deep, structural reforms. And, time alone will tell whether the states will take over and bring in the much-needed changes to the farm sector."
17,https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/withdrawal-of-farm-laws-is-a-missed-chance-for-a-progressive-indian-society-121112200123_1.html,economics,"Now that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sacrificed his poorly designed makeover of India’s farms at the altar of electoral math, there will perhaps be no fresh attempt at reform for a decade. That’s a shame for urbanization.

Agriculture in the second-most-populous nation suffers from many infirmities: Unlike the Japanese rulers of Taiwan in the first half of the 20th century, Britain’s colonial government in India didn’t give tenants secure rights, dooming post-independence land reforms. Holdings are fragmented and uneconomical; crop diversification beyond rice and wheat is poor; subsidies abound but public investment is paltry.

With the 1960s spurt from high-yielding seeds having run its course, farming in India badly needs a fresh productivity boost. As long as 43% of the workforce remains stuck in agriculture to eke out a living, the labor that would power industrialization won’t get released. The household capital that would drive urban growth can’t form in a subsistence economy where cultivation gets the average farmer 27 rupees ($0.36) a day.

The question is, what will deliver this productivity boost — markets or organizations?





ALSO READ: SKM to hold meeting on Nov 27 to decide on ongoing farmers' protests

Team Modi believed that opening up markets — by allowing farmers to sell produce outside of designated “mandi” yards — held the answer. Farmers, who set out on a bitter, yearlong struggle against Modi’s farm laws, thought otherwise: They feared that with the yards falling into disuse, state procurement of food grain at assured prices would wither away. Modi’s reforms promised long-term purchase contracts with private buyers. That also raised suspicions of exploitation by big business groups as disputes wouldn’t be adjudicated in a civil court but settled by officials.

Skeptical of the assurance that the new deal would improve their overall position, farmers dug in their heels. In January, India’s Supreme Court stayed implementation of the three farm laws, yet the protests didn’t let up.

Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, two states at the forefront of the farmers’ agitation, will go to polls next year. With no end to the impasse in sight, Modi ran out of will to defend his reforms. The entire package has been unceremoniously scrapped. While the capitulation would no doubt dent the prime minister’s strongman image and disappoint his backers, it also shows that a more organizational approach to reforms might have had a better chance than a blind devotion to markets.

Replicating the success India has had with Amul, a $5 billion dairy cooperative, might do more for prosperity than telling farmers they can sell to whomever they wish. Who’s there to buy except for the government and a few large traders? Someone needs to invest in transport, warehousing, processing, distribution — and, like in Amul’s case — brand-building. The collective, with a little help from New Delhi, was able to coax Nestle SA to share its chocolate-making technology in the 1960s, when India didn’t even have a mass market for the sweets. It does now. Policies that help producers’ organizations capture more of the farm-to-fork value chain would mean better prices for farmers.

At the same time, prices will be affordable to an urban working class routinely subjected to food inflation shocks. This year’s surge in edible oil prices holds a lesson. Traders bringing in Indonesian palm oil and refining it have made a killing, but farmers who could take the price signal to boost supply of indigenous cold-pressed filtered oils like groundnut or mustard are reluctant to increase acreage. They don’t know if policymakers are content leaving 1.4 billion Indians hooked to a foreign cooking medium — or more bizarre still, if they don’t mind destroying pristine forests in India’s northeast with palm plantations just because a politically connected Yoga guru thinks it’s an excellent idea.

The choice is between good organizations and bad. In producing sugar from sugarcane, India exports scarce water at throwaway prices. But the powerful cooperatives that control the industry have their vested interests. Ditto in Punjab, where wealthy “arhatiyas” who aggregate produce from individual farmers, have a huge stake in the status quo and the commission income it brings them. Which means Punjab must keep producing rice, even though the water-guzzling crop is a wrong choice for the state. The burning of paddy stubs as farmers prepare their fields for wheat contributes to the poisonous winter air of New Delhi, the capital.

The government has to strike a new bargain in which more than $100 billion in annual subsidies for food, farming and village unemployment are slowly replaced by a basic income, empowered farmers’ collectives and robust public infrastructure, such as more efficient, less corrupt mandi yards. To think that the power of markets, unleashed by three laws, will magically solve this complex political-economy problem demonstrates naivety. In forcing his package down the throat of farmers--and then beating a retreat--Modi has made it impossible for better-conceived reforms to have a chance.

That will delay the moment that arrived in England in the mid-19th country and in East Asia 100 years later, when the share of farmers in the workforce declined to less than a third, and urban concerns began to trump rural interests. India’s sclerotic farm economy sends desperate, landless poor to cities when it should be the bedrock of a more secure and permanent urban proletariat, one that can cast aside the rigid mores of village life — including the pernicious caste system — and make the society more progressive. That’s the ultimate tragedy."

In an interview with PTI, Bajaj said the relief in excise duty on petrol and diesel and customs duty on edible oil will cost the exchequer about Rs 80,000 crore this financial year, and the revenue department will start calculating the tax mop-up position vis-a-vis budget estimates for this fiscal after the December advance tax number.

""After refunds also, we have touched almost Rs 6 lakh crore till October in direct taxes... It is looking good. Hopefully, we should exceed it.

""Though we have given a lot of relief in indirect taxes in petrol, diesel and edible oil, also there are some sunset that have come in customs duty where the total benefit would be about Rs 75,000-80,000 crore, but still I think we should exceed the budgeted estimates on both direct and indirect taxes,"" Bajaj said.

The government has budgeted a 9.5 per cent growth in at Rs 22.2 lakh crore for 2021-22 fiscal (April-March). In the last fiscal, the mop-up was Rs 20.2 lakh crore.

Of this, revenues from direct taxes are estimated to be around Rs 11 lakh, including Rs 5.47 lakh crore from corporate tax and Rs 5.61 lakh crore from income tax.

With regard to the goods and services tax (GST) revenues, Bajaj said the collections in November will also be good numbers but December mop-up will be little lukewarm. The pick-up in collections will be visible again in the March quarter.

""The revenues are looking good, GST revenues are also good. We crossed Rs 1.30 lakh crore (in October). This month, I think we should get a good GST number. This was Diwali, our GST revenue will keep changing.

""But, i think the run rate should not go below Rs 1.15 lakh crore. Overall, we should do well in GST, excise duty and customs duty, also we will achieve our budgeted estimates. So, overall, we will exceed,"" Bajaj said.

Customs collection in the current fiscal is budgeted at Rs 1.36 lakh crore, excise duty at Rs 3.35 lakh crore. Besides, Centre's GST revenues, including compensation cess, are pegged at Rs 6.30 lakh crore.

Established in 2005, the India-US TPF met last in October 2017. It was then replaced by negotiations between the two sides on a

With the Biden administration now insisting on resolving irritants first, rather than going for a mini deal, the focus on TPF has again emerged.

There could also be discussions to promote both nations’ shared interests in the Indo-Pacific region, people aware of the matter said.

“Since the US government has made it clear that a (mini) with India will not be possible, at least for now, another focus area is likely to sort out market access issues and matters on the Indo-Pacific region,” one of the persons, cited above, said.

“A major breakthrough on any trade-related issue between India and the US is difficult (for now) without any investment deal between both the countries. There could also be an expectation to firm up an investment deal (from the US’ side),” the person said.

Tai is set to meet commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Monday. This is also her first visit to India since she assumed office in March.

The US is the biggest destination for India’s exports, though its outbound shipments have been much lower compared to China.

While India exported $29.75 billion to the US, China received only $16.42 billion of exports during the first five months of the current fiscal year from India.

However, when it comes to exports to India, US share was much less at $16.42 billion than China’s at $34.15 billion during this period.

The US was the biggest trading partner of India, slightly bigger than China during April-August 2021-22. But China was the biggest trading partner in certain years, for instance during 2020-21 and 2017-18. The US has been raising the issue of market barriers in India, including high tariffs. New Delhi has also been flagging this matter against Washington.

The US also believes that the Indian regulatory regime is “non-transparent and unpredictable.” According to the US Department of Commerce’s International Trade Agency, US exporters and investors face non-transparent and often unpredictable regulatory and tariff regimes. This is because some goods and services have limited access to the Indian market."

It also spelt out various measures to correct the situation, including the need to increase domestic consumption of the beverage.

In a submission before Union Industry and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal here, TAI president Ajay Jalan said supply outstrips the demand and it is one of the root cause of the problem.

""We have to regulate supply and create demand for tea,"" he added.

Advocating for promotion of tea consumption, he pointed that per capita consumption of tea in India is as low as 830 grams per head/year as compared to 1.61 kg per head in the UK or 1.01 kg per head per year in Pakistan.

""An increase of even by 100 gram per capita consumption would lead to consumption of another 131 million kg annually,"" Jalan added.

He said there is a need to promote tea as a super food/beverage highlighting the immense health benefits of tea.

He urged the government to allocate funds for generic promotion of tea and entrust this promotion to a professional agency.

Jalan further said another way to regulate supply is by curbing the import of tea to India.

He said out of 69.35 million kg imported in last three years, only 23.43 million kg were re-exported, and the rest 36.92 million kg were retained in India for domestic use.

""This imported tea creates additional pressure on demand-supply equilibrium in the domestic market leading to further economic un-sustainability of tea industry,"" he added.

To check import, the TAI suggested imposition of minimum import price, anti-dumping duties, vigorous implementation of the laws of the land related to FSSAI regulations on origin, food safety, sanitary and phytosanitary regulations, etc.

The Association further requested the Union minister to invoke provisions of Tea Act and Tea Control Order 2003 to devise a scheme that would determine a remunerative price for the industry which may be charged by growers or manufactures linked with specified quality.

The TAI also raised the issue of reduced export to Iran, with the amount coming down from 53.70 million kg in 2019 to 33.37 million kg last year.

""This state of affairs has arisen due to payment related issues and this needs resolution so that India can maintain its foothold on Iranian export front,"" it added.

The issues related to logistics were also put forth by the Association, including unavailability of containers.

It also called for measures to reduce dependency on the road transport mode as it consumes maximum cost of logistics.

Besides making a verbal submission before Goyal, the TAI president also handed a written note on the issues raised by the organisation.

With this, Magnetic 2.0 was in its seventh edition and its first international edition.

The memorandum of understanding (MoUs) signed are in key sectors such as auto and auto components, logistics, electric vehicles, textiles, data centre, pharma, bio-fuels and energy, said MIDC in its release.

This proposed investment would have potential direct employment generation for 10,851 people.

Companies looking to invest in Maharashtra are from Japan, Singapore, Sweden, Korea, Germany and Italy, it said.

The Maharashtra government is participating in expo between November 19, 2021 and 2nd December 2021 and has a delegation led by Minister of Industries, Subhash Desai, joined by other seniors of Industries department between the 19th and 21st of November 2021, said the release.

Currently, tax rate on MMF, MMF yarn and MMF fabrics is 18 per cent, 12 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.

The taxation of inputs at higher rates than finished products created build up of credits and cascading costs. It further led to accumulation of taxes at various stages of the MMF value chain and blockage of crucial working capital for the industry.

The Council, chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and comprising state finance ministers, had in its previous meeting on September 17 decided that the inverted duty anomalies in the textile sector would be corrected from January 1, 2022.

Giving effect to this decision, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) on November 18 notified 12 per cent rate for MMF, MMF yarn and MMF fabrics.

Experts said though there is a provision in GST law to claim the unutilised Input Tax Credit (ITC) as a refund, there were other complications and resulted in more compliance burden. The inverted tax structure caused an effective increase in the rate of taxation of the sector.

The world textiles trade has been moving towards MMF but India was not able to take advantage of the trend as its MMF segment was throttled by the inverted tax regime, they said, adding the correction in duty anomaly will help the segment grow and emerge as a big job provider.

EY Tax Partner Bipin Sapra said the rate changes in the textile industry is the first of the changes promised by the GST Council with an aim to rectify inverted duty structure and bring an efficient tax structure for a given sector.

""The provisional payroll data of released today highlights that the has added around 15.41 lakh net subscribers during the month of September 2021,"" a statement by the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) said on Saturday.

For the month of September, the net subscriber addition has increased by 1.81 lakh (or over 13 per cent) as compared to the previous month of August 2021 when it was 13.60 lakh.

The data reflects a growing trend in net payroll for the first six months of the current financial year except in May, when the nation was reeling under the second wave of COVID-19. Many states had imposed local lockdowns during the period which hit economic activities.

The EPFO had net added 8,06,765 subscribers in April, which decreased to 5,62,216 in May this year.

The net enrolments rose to 9,71,244 in June and further to 12,30,696 in July.

The total net enrolments with the EPFO during first half of this fiscal (April to September 2021) stood at 64.72 lakh. The net new enrolments were 77.08 lakh in full fiscal 2020-21 and 78.58 lakh in 2019-20.

The EPFO stated that out of the total 15.41 lakh net subscribers added in September, around 8.95 lakh new members have been registered under the provisions of the EPF & MP Act, 1952 for the first time.

Around 6.46 lakh subscribers exited but rejoined EPFO by changing jobs within the establishments covered under the Employees' Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provision Act (EPF & MP Act), 1952. These members opted to continue their membership with EPFO by transferring their funds instead of going for final withdrawal.

Age-wise comparison of payroll data shows that the age-group of 22-25 years registered the highest number of net enrolments at 4.12 lakh during September 2021.

This was followed by 18-21 years with around 3.18 lakh net enrolments. This indicates that many first-time job seekers are joining organised sector workforce in large numbers. They have contributed around 47.39 per cent of total net subscriber additions in September.

State-wise comparison highlights that the establishments covered in Maharashtra, Haryana, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were in lead by adding approximately 9.41 lakh subscribers during the month, or around 61 per cent of the total net payroll addition across all age groups.

Gender-wise analysis shows that the net share of female enrolment during the month was around 3.27 lakh.

The net addition of female subscribers increased roughly by 0.60 lakh in September in comparison to the previous month of August 2021, when 2.67 lakh net subscribers were added into the payroll. This was largely due to lower female member exits during the month.

Industry-wise payroll data indicates that 'expert services' category (consisting of manpower agencies, private security agencies and small contractors etc) constituted 41.22 per cent of total subscriber additions during the month.

Apart from this, growing trend in net payroll additions has been noted in industries like trading, commercial establishments, engineering products, building and construction, textiles, garment making, hospitals and financing establishments.

The payroll data is provisional as updation of employee records is a continuous process. The previous data hence gets updated every month.

From the month of May 2018, EPFO has been releasing payroll data covering the period September 2017 onwards.

The EPFO is a social security organisation responsible for providing a number of social security benefits to the members covered under the EPF & MP Act, 1952.

An award ceremony for five-star rated mines for noteworthy performance will be another highlight of the one-day conclave, an official statement said.

At the onset of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015, the regime of auction for grant of mineral concessions has brought about transparency and removed discretion in the and auction process.

This has not only resulted in substantial increase in revenue to the state governments, but also brought about the paradigm of ease of doing business in the mining sector, it added.

The mines ministry introduced the concept of National Mining Conclave in 2016 in order to provide the right platform for meaningful interaction among all stakeholders like central and state government officers, the real executors in the auction regime, industrial sector and industry associations.

The national conclaves are reckoned as an overwhelming success in providing an effective platform to showcase the key policy initiatives undertaken by the Centre and have helped the government in garnering valuable feedback for furthering the efforts to enable steady growth of the mineral sector.

The mines ministry had launched the scheme of 'Star Rating of Mines' for awarding the mining lease owners in 2016 for their efforts and initiatives for implementation of the Sustainable Development Framework (SDF).

One to five stars are awarded to mines based on the provisions stipulated, with the best performing leases being given five stars.

The mining lease holders with five-star rating for the last three years will be felicitated in the conclave to encourage sustainable mining, the statement said.

Further, 52 potential mineral blocks carved out of G4 stage mineral investigations will be handed over to the state governments during the conclave.

The blocks are located across 15 states, including two blocks in northeastern states, six in Chhattisgarh, eight in Madhya Pradesh and six blocks in Maharashtra.

These comprise many minerals and deposits such as eight limestone blocks, eight gold blocks, eight iron ore blocks, among other minerals.

Auctioning of these blocks, along with 100 blocks recently handed over in September this year, will further strengthen the mineral economy, it added.

Sale of non-core assets such as land parcels or real estate of over Rs 100 crore is being managed by DIPAM, and is similar to the pipeline of core assets created for monetisation by the NITI Aayog. The idea is to put idle land parcels of state-owned entities to use, and realise their value. The effort is on the lines of the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) -- where the government aims to monetise underutlised assets), but would only include non-core assets.

It is also looking at imposing goods and services tax (GST) on the trade in virtual currencies.

People are already paying capital gains on income from cryptocurrencies, and the GST law provides for taxing such transactions as ‘services’, Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj told PTI.

Investments in cryptocurrencies have surged lately with expectations of higher returns. These currencies have also gained wider acceptance among youth.

The tax department’s view has been that taxing such “intangible” assets won’t mean that trading in them will be legitimised. “We will take a call. I understand that already people are paying taxes on it. Now that it has really grown a lot, we will see whether we can actually bring in some changes in law position or not. But that would be a Budget activity. We are already nearing the Budget; we have to look at that point of time,” Bajaj said.

The revenue department is also examining if exchanges can be classified as e-commerce platforms and imposed 1 per cent tax-collected at source (TCS).

Responding to a query whether TCS provisions could be introduced for crypto trading, Bajaj told PTI “if we come up with a new law, then we will see what is to be done"". “But yes, if you make money you have to pay taxes...We have already got some taxes. Some have treated it as an asset and paid capital gains tax on it,” he added.

The government is also looking at classifying exchanges into three categories: Those that act as a facilitator, brokerages that allow buying and selling, and trading platforms that provide an interface for trading, Business Standard reported earlier.

Asked whether people involved in trading would be categorised as facilitator, brokerage and trading platform and how the would be done under GST, Bajaj told PTI that “there would already be such things available in other services also. So whatever GST rate they are taxed at, that will be applicable to them. They have to get themselves registered. The GST law is very clear. If there is an activity, if there is a broker who is helping people and charging brokerage fee, GST would get charged,” he said.

Separately, the government is also planning to introduce a Bill on cryptocurrencies during the Winter Session of Parliament beginning November 29, amid concerns over such currencies being allegedly used for luring investors with misleading claims.

Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting on cryptocurrencies, and noted that attempts were being made to mislead youth by over-promising and non-transparent advertising, and should be stopped.

It is also seen by them as an opportunity to reduce the deficit.



For the path to GVC, an economy’s government and private sector should work in coordination to develop its domestic manufacturing companies to enable them to compete globally. This involves innovation coupled with skilling manpower and at the same time enabling competitive global access. Reducing the cost of compliance and developing infrastructure facilities also seems necessary on which India is in the front run.



was the leading country that took advantage of production fragmentation witnessed in global since the 1990s. It is considered as the manufacturing hub as also the assembling point of the products of the leading electronic companies. There was also about some of the firms shifting production out of emanating from the US- tensions since 2019. Studies also reported relocation of firms from China to other countries mainly to Vietnam, Taiwan, and Thailand.



However, the intricacies of this GVC concept and its linkage with trade statistics may lead us to interesting conclusions. This may be best explained with the help of China-US trade.



Implications on trade statistics



Most Chinese exports to the US are manufactured and traded via GVCs where Chinese firms mainly specialize in low-value-added tasks while lead firms of GVCs concentrate on high-value-added tasks. The popularity and rapid expansion of “Made in China” products in the US is largely facilitated by the spillover effects of brands, originating from the intellectual property of GVC lead firms.



Value chain trade represents a new division of labour in the same product and differs significantly from conventional cloth-for wine trade in terms of organization and the composition of value added. Production of ready-to-use information and communication technology products is organized along value chains, where China is the centre for assembly of parts and components supplied by other countries, such as Japan, the US, Germany, and South Korea.



Taking advantage of GVCs, many American multinational corporations (MNCs) have turned factory-less, for example, Apple and Nike. In 2012, 21 of S&P 500 index companies were exclusively factory-less manufacturing, including Nike, AMD, Qualcomm Inc., and Cisco System (Bayard and Byrne, 2015). These factory-less MNCs mainly derive revenues from their intellectual property, such as brand, patented technology, and distribution networks.



In the perspective of GVCs, the inconsistency between trade statistics and modern trade based on GVC is a major cause of the huge imbalance between China and the US. (Yuqing Xing 2019). Trade statistics are compiled with an implicit assumption that the full value of exported good is created by the exporting nation. The same is not true in GVC trade. It only counts the goods crossing national borders as exports/imports. It fails to recognize the reality that geographic locations of production and the ownership of manufacturing products are separated in GVC trade. It cannot record the revenues of multinational enterprises derived from their intangible intellectual property in foreign markets.



The degree of the statistic distortion reached the highest for the bilateral trade balance between China and the US, as the former is the global centre of manufacturing assembly, while the latter is the home of most factory-less manufacturers. Current trade statistics do not recognize the revenue as part of US exports, because their products sold in global markets do not cross the US border, and the value added of their intellectual property is embedded in physical products rather than sold separately as royalties or license fees.



Apple’s sales in China were $56.5 billion in 2015, but not even one dollar of the sales was counted as US exports to China. All Apple products are designed by Apple in California and assembled in China. Chinese consumers paid not only the production costs of Apple products but also the value added of Apple’ intellectual property (Brand, design, IOS systems, etc.) embedded in these products. The value added captured by Apple is a missing export of the US. In 2015, the value added gained by Apple in the Chinese market was estimated at $19.2 billion, much larger than any other single item (soybeans, airplanes, etc.) listed in trade statistics. Apple products should be the single largest item the US exported to China. If the value added were considered as a US export to China, its exports to China would rise by a significant percentage and the corresponding fall in the deficit would also have been reflected.



This interesting scenario is common to all countries involved or may involve future in GVC, especially one like India, which has a large customer base. In value chains, Chinese firms’ relations with lead firms are asymmetric. This arrangement frees Chinese firms of the risks associated with R&D, brand development, and marketing. But, when lead firms decide to search for alternative suppliers, Chinese firms face the danger of being cut off from GVCs. The US-China trade confrontation clearly demonstrated the vulnerability of GVC strategy. The trade war was cutting off the linkage of Chinese contract manufacturers with existing GVCs, and may damage China’s export capacity in the long run.

The containers were not destined for Mundra Port or any other port in India but were en route from Karachi in Pakistan to Shanghai in China, the government authorities had them offloaded at Mundra Port for further inspection, said the company.

The Acts, which were brought in with much fervour as part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat package in June last year after the first lockdown, have been mired in controversy since the beginning, with a section of growers seeing them as an assault on the MSP-based procurement system, while some others said they would strike at Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs).

The protesting farmers also alleged that the Acts were a stepping-stone for big corporations to get into farming.

States such as Punjab have been against the laws on the grounds that they were an affront to the states’ powers to make laws on agriculture.





Some experts want to watch further developments before concluding that the PM’s move is a setback to farm reforms.

“I feel this is a tactical retreat, not a surrender, in the light of the elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Agriculture will continue to grow at its long-term average of 3.5-4 per cent per annum. But, if tomorrow, the opposition starts going against all the existing reforms through mobilisation on streets then something like Air India disinvestment could also come under pressure,” Ashok Gulati, Infosys Chair Professor for Agriculture at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, told Business Standard.

“I don’t think it is a setback for the reforms in agriculture as of now, but yes, if tomorrow someone gives legal guarantees for MSPs then it will definitely be a reversal,” Gulati said.

However, some others said the repeal was a good step.

“The Centre should not have interfered in the domain of the states in the first place. Now that the Acts will be withdrawn, it is up to the states to take meaningful reforms in agricultural marketing, not just to attract big investment but to protect the interests of small and marginal farmers,” Sukhpal Singh, chairperson of the Centre for Management in Agriculture at IIM Ahmedabad, said.

“Giving small farmers new channels to sell their produce through direct purchase, private mandis, and contract farming is all to the good, but the way in which the Centre was doing it, giving a free hand to companies without worrying about the interests of farmers, was one-sided,” Singh said.

The farmers’ agitation, which started as stray protests in some villages of Punjab, gathered steam and spread to other parts of the country, including Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan.

The protests reached a crescendo when thousands of farmers from Punjab and elsewhere marched towards Delhi late last year and decided to block the main entry points once they were denied entry.

The Centre, on its part, held 11 rounds of discussion with them and offered to amend some of the provisions of the laws, but without much success, as the protestors stuck to their main demand of annulment.

The violent events of January 26, 2021, when scores of agitating farmers deviated from a fixed tractor rally route and forced entry into the main thoroughfares, leading to pitched battles with the police, were seen as a setback for the stir. However, the forced eviction of Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait and his emotional outburst revived the sagging morale of the agitators.

And within days, western Uttar Pradesh became the new epicentre of the protests, which shifted from Punjab and Haryana.

The Supreme Court intervened and constituted a high-powered panel of experts to study the three laws and suggest a way forward.

The protesting farmers rejected the panel because it consisted of people known to have favoured the laws in some forum or the other.

The panel submitted its report to the apex court in due course but little has been heard about it. One of the panel members wrote to the Chief Justice, requesting him to make the report public.

At several flashpoints, the crowds had thinned considerably from what they were at their peak. This the farm leaders say is due to the peak paddy harvesting season and wheat sowing in several parts of the country."

""Additionally, healthy Central and state government spending, robust merchandise exports and continuing demand from the farm sector supported economic activity in that quarter.""

An indication of a robust trend in the production of major Kharif crops also seemed to have supported the growth, the report added.

The report cited that revenue expenditure for 22 states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh expanded by 13.1 per cent in Q2FY22, as compared to 1 0.6 per cent in Q1FY22.

“We have lost out on trade. We have had trade stagnation in the past decade. Some of this is related to an increase in protectionism, the other to a somewhat misguided exchange rate policy, which is heavily overvalued,” said the former Reserve Bank of India deputy governor at a Global Economic Policy Summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.

In response, the CEA said there is an important distinction between the exchange rate policy and raising production via PLI.

Emphasising the important aspect of the is that it incentivises growth, Subramanian said while in 1991 the product markets were opened, not enough attention was paid to the factor markets.

He clarified that he is not only including labour and capital in the factor markets, but also the nature of production or the scale of production itself.

The CEA said PLI is more than democratised subsidies.

“It is directed towards growth, providing firms incentives to be closer to optimal scale, reap economies of scale, and reduce their average cost,” he said.

He cited the Economic Survey of 2018-19, penned by him, to emphasise that the government policy in the last seven decades has provided perverse incentives to firms.

The government has already announced the PLI scheme for 13 sectors, including electronics, medical devices, pharmaceutical drugs, telecommunication and networking products, food products, air conditioners, light-emitting diodes, automobiles and automotive components, textile products, and specialty steel.

Subramanian also did not agree with Mohan’s view that 1991 witnessed a second generation of economic reforms.

Mohan said the first generation (first-gen) of economic reforms were initiated soon after Independence, when a comprehensive approach to growth and development was made through planning and import substitution.

Subramanian refused to call the Nehurvian-era policies first-gen reforms. The first-gen reforms were initiated in 1991, he said.

Mohan emphasised on the need for third-generation reforms, which would underscore public delivery of goods and services, particularly related to long-neglected health, education, water, and sanitation.

Kelkar’s prescription

The 13th Finance Commission Chairman Vijay Kelkar suggested reforming the goods and services tax (GST) by going for a single rate of 12 per cent.

“We have a bizarre system of four to five rates. No wonder we have so much litigation. I would recommend the government announce a single rate of 12 per cent, including 6 per cent central GST and 6 per cent state GST,” he said.

He also batted for expanding its coverage by including petroleum, real estate, and land in it. He also called for sharing GST revenues with local bodies to deliver public services and goods.

This will take the total installed capacity to 7 GW. Coal India Ltd (CIL) alone has planned to install 3 GW of solar power in the next five years to achieve its net zero target, the ministry said in a statement.

With the recent announcement on new climate targets by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at COP26 under 'Panchamrit Strategy', India has taken a big step towards cementing its commitment to clean energy.

Since coal has to play a role of primary fuel for power generation in the country for the time being, till renewable source fully caters to our energy demand, the Ministry of Coal in line with the commitment has already moved forward with a comprehensive Sustainable Development Plan, according to the statement.

Action has already started for its speedy implementation. Emphasis is to put major thrust on sustainable development in coal mining, taking care of its environmental and social impact.

A full-fledged sustainable development cell (SDC) in the coal ministry has been established to advise, mentor and plan action to minimise the adverse impact of mining. Apart from suggesting the way forward, its implementation and monitoring, SDC is also formulating a future policy framework for environmental mitigation in the coal and lignite sector of the country.

Extensive work by CIL and its subsidiaries along with Singareni Coal Company Ltd (SCCL) and NLC India Ltd (NLCIL) has already started, effect of which could now be seen in some of these mining companies.

In line with the commitment of India to reduce the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now onwards till 2030, bio-reclamation of mined out land has already been taken up on a big scale by all coal companies through a massive tree plantation drive, it said.

In the next five years, target is to cover more than 12,000 hectares of land for plantation, which will help in having carbon sink potential to the tune of more than one lakh tonne per annum. Monitoring of such efforts is being done through remote sensing.

First-mile connectivity (FMC) is a major initiative by coal companies to minimise environmental pollution, where coal is being transported through conveyor belt from coal handling plants to silo for loading. This process eliminates movement of coal through road. Taking a big step, 39 such projects have been planned to be commissioned by 2023-24 with an investment of over Rs 13,000 crore, the ministry said.

CIL alone will enhance its mechanical loading and transport of coal from the present level of 120 million tonnes to 565 million tonnes by 2023-24. These FMC projects will save diesel worth Rs 2,100 crore per annum. There will be a reduction in vehicle density by 2,770 trucks per hour paving the way for significant reduction in carbon emission.

Similarly, surface coal gasification projects have been planned for syngas production to be used further either for production of methanol/ethanol, urea or petrochemicals. This will be a way forward for use of the dry fuel as green coal with relatively lesser carbon footprintand environmental pollution, it added.

One such CIL joint venture (JV) project of 2.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) capacity is already in operation in Talcher Coalfield in Odisha. Other five projects with an investment of about Rs 30,000 crore is under formulation by various subsidiaries of CIL.

The use of LNG to substitute diesel consumption in mining and coal transport equipment has also been planned on a massive scale. A pilot project has been initiated in one of the coal companies. This technology will be replicated shortly in coal transporting dumpers in the first phase for substantial reduction in carbon footprint, the statement said.

On showcasing the clean environment front, 12 new ecoparks in mining area are under different stages of development in all the subsidiaries of CIL, SCCL and NLCIL, and will be completed by the next year.

Extraction of sand from overburden (OB) dump for use in construction is another unique initiative for sustainable development. In addition to this, energy-efficiency measures are also being taken for reduction in carbon footprint. New environment-friendly mining equipment have been introduced on a mass scale by different coal companies to mitigate the impact of carbon emission, it said.

All these activities will pave way in coming five years for benchmarking a better sustainable development effort by on economic, environmental and social front and also in line with the commitment made in COP26.

Currently, assessees cannot take the refunds of this after two years. That time bar has been lifted by the government.

The Central Board of Indirect taxes and Customs (CBIC) has issued necessary clarifications in this regard.

A taxpayer claiming refund under is required to file a refund application to the authorities within the two years from the ‘relevant date’. Generally, the relevant date is the date of payment of tax. But in case of exports, it is the date on which a ship or aircraft leaves India.

Under GST, the taxpayer is first required to deposit cash into the electronic cash ledger (ECL) maintained on the GSTN portal. This cash balance lying in ECL can be utilized by the taxpayer against their tax liability reported in returns.

Practically, one may notice that there exist cases where taxpayers have deposited excess amounts in their ECL which could not be utilized against any tax liability.

At times this amount may remain in ECL for more than 2 years.

Field officers were rejecting refund applications relating to such amounts lying in ECL arguing that two years have been lapsed and thus such an amount cannot be available as refund to the taxpayer, Sunil Kumar, deputy general manager at Taxmann, said.

In this backdrop, the CBIC has issued a clarification that the limitation period of two years will not be applicable for refund of excess balance lying in ECL.

“The refund clarifications are useful as the same is likely to improve working capital management for dealers with excess balance in electronic cash ledgers. Such dealers thus far, were unable to use alternatively the excess balance in their electronic cash ledgers” said Harpreet Singh, Partner at KPMG India

Rajat Mohan, senior partner at AMRG & Associates, said the move will help in easing cash flow of companies.

Kumar said CBIC seems to have taken the view that the amount deposited in ECL does not carry the character of tax.

He, however, said the clarification does not specify whether the move would be applicable to disputed cases in courts.

""The CBIC view would also be beneficial for the ongoing litigations relating to excess payment of tax under various cases such as amount paid during investigation stages, amount wrongly paid by the taxpayers, levy which later held as unconstitutional by the judiciary. It can be argued that the limitation period will not be applicable in these cases too,"" he said.

In a similar pattern, CBIC also clarified that assessees are entitled to get refund of lying in ECL due to tax deducted at source (TDS) or tax collected at source (TCS) under the GST regime. TCS could be levied if someone uses an ecommerce platform for selling its goods. TDS and TCS could also be levied if a company is dealing with the government.

Kumar said the tax department was rejecting the refund applications relating to such accumulation, saying that it’s not a cash deposited by the taxpayer and thus refund may not be available. Till now, this amount can only be utilized against the tax liability.

Kumar said since this money is treated at par with the cash deposited, one may also take a view that a two year time bar would also not be applicable in this case.

CBIC also clarified that those making payments outside but place of supply is in India are not required to have dynamic QR code on their invoices.

Harpreet Singh of KPMG explained that for transactions which do not qualify as exports, as the place of supply is in India, but the recipient is outside India, the requirement of printing QR code was not serving the intended purpose.

“This is because QR code is mandated by the government so that consumers/ recipients of services can pay through digital modes which makes it easy for authorities to track the supplies. But where the recipient of service is outside India, the QR code would not be used for making payments and hence it is good that requirement of printing QR code on such invoices has been done away with,” explained Singh."

The domestic rating agency's earlier estimate for real GDP growth for the July-September period was 7.7 per cent. The GDP had grown by over 20 per cent in Q1FY22 on a low base as the pandemic's first wave raged. The RBI has forecast a 9.5 per cent growth rate in FY22.

""Economic activity in Q2 FY22 was supported by a pick-up in industrial and service sector volumes after the second wave of Covid-19 subsided and rising vaccine coverage revived confidence. Additionally, healthy Central and state Government spending, robust merchandise exports and continuing demand from the farm sector supported economic activity in that quarter,"" its chief economist Aditi Nayar said.

Nayar said this would be an improvement when compared to the COVID second wave-hit first quarter of the fiscal.

A normalising base is expected to lead to a moderation in the growth when compared with the year-ago period, the agency said.

The central government's non-interest revenue expenditure expanded by 15 per cent in Q2FY22, compared to the contraction of 7.3 per cent in Q1FY22. Additionally, for the 22 state governments for which data is available, revenue expenditure expanded by 13.1 per cent in Q2FY22, a step up from the 10.6 per cent growth in Q1FY22.

The agency estimates growth by gross value added basis for the industry, services and agriculture, forestry and fishing to come at 8.5 per cent, 7.9 per cent and 3.0 per cent, respectively, for the quarter.

""Flows to India (the world's largest recipient of remittances) are expected to reach USD 87 billion, a gain of 4.6 per cent with the severity of COVID-19 caseloads and deaths during the second quarter (well above the global average) playing a prominent role in drawing altruistic flows (including for the purchase of oxygen tanks) to the country,"" the report stated.

to low- and middle-income countries are projected to have grown a strong 7.3 per cent to reach USD 589 billion in 2021, the bank said.

This return to growth is more robust than earlier estimates and follows the resilience of flows in 2020 when declined by only 1.7 per cent despite a severe global recession due to COVID-19, according to estimates from the World Bank's Migration and Development Brief.

""Remittance flows from migrants have greatly complemented government cash transfer programs to support families suffering economic hardships during the COVID-19 crisis.

Facilitating the flow of remittances to provide relief to strained household budgets should be a key component of government policies to support a global recovery from the pandemic,"" said Michal Rutkowski, Global Director for Social Protection and Jobs.

India had received over USD 83 billion in remittances in 2020.

A works contract is essentially a contract of service that may also involve supply of goods in the execution of the agreement.

It is basically a composite supply of both services and goods, with the service element being dominant in the contract between parties.

The authority ruled in a case related to an agreement between TIF Integrated Industrial Parks (TIFIIP) and the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC), said Sandeep Sehgal, director, tax and regulatory, AKM Global, a tax and consulting firm.

TIFIIP is a company formed by industrialists as required by TSIIC as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) representing the member industrialists. It has an objective of providing industrial infrastructure by development of land acquired by the corporation. TSIIC issued a final allotment letter for 377 acres of land for Rs 55.11 crore on Vijayawada Highway to set up an industrial corridor.

A sale agreement was executed between TIFIIP and TSIIC, but a sale deed will be executed upon completion of development of internal infrastructure.

Similarly, TIFIIP is authorised, in turn, to sell pieces of land to individual industrialists after each of the allottees commences commercial operation by executing individual sale deeds.

TIFIIP sought to know from AAR whether the sale agreement would draw

AAR ruled that the activity undertaken by the applicant for construction at the immovable property would qualify to be a “works contract” if it is executed in pursuance of a contract or agreement; there is transfer of property in the execution of works contract from the contractor to the contractee; and there is a consideration paid by the contractee to the contractor.

AAR said perusal of the contract entered by the applicant with the TSIIC clearly indicated that the property in land will be transferred to the applicant only when the TIFIIP completes the development of infrastructure of scheduled land. However, this clause in the agreement appears to have been made to meet the larger objective enumerated in the industrial policy of the state.

Though there is a contract for development of the land, the other conditions – transfer of property from the applicant to the TSIIC and payment of consideration by TSIIC to the applicant – have not been fulfilled.

As such, there would not be any in this deal, it ruled.

However, if the applicant sells the land after developing it by way of erecting a civil structure or a building or a complex, then such supply is liable to tax under laws.

Sehgal said, “Telangana AAR has looked into the substance of the transaction and held that the essential element of a transaction is the sale of land and it will not be subject to GST.”"

The 2021 data indicates a strong rebound in India-US bilateral trade, according to a US official.

US Consul General Judith Ravin said the growth in economic ties between the two countries has been extraordinary, with trade exploding from approximately USD 20 billion in 2001 to just over USD 145 billion in 2019.

Even as the pandemic has taken its toll on trade, the United States remains India's biggest trading partner and largest export market, she noted in her virtual address at India-U.S. Tech Conclave in Bengaluru Tech Summit 2021, which commenced on Wednesday.

""The 2021 data indicates a strong rebound, and if it continues, we could be on track to exceed our 2019 numbers"", Ravin said.

In addition, she said, U.S. companies continue to be the biggest source of foreign direct investment, fuelling continued growth in India.

Regarding bilateral trade, United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai will travel to New Delhi on November 22 to meet with her counterpart, Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal, according to Ravin.

""Both agreed to take a comprehensive look at ways to expand the bilateral trade relationship"", the Consul General at the U.S. Consulate General in Chennai, said.

Ravin said when it comes to business, there is no stronger partner to India than the United States. ""We believe that India's economic strength is not just in India's interest, but in the interest of the United States, the region, and the world"".

She said the U.S.-India bilateral relationship continues to expand on diverse fronts, from collaboration on mitigating the impacts of (Covid-19) and climate change, to space exploration and our joint commitment towards a free and open

Ravin said Indian private sector investments in the United States have also grown significantly in the last decade.

Total foreign direct investment from India, as of 2020, was USD 12.7 billion, with Software and IT Services being the top recipient by industry sector, she added.

Consumers continue to get relief from rising as oil marketing companies (OMCs) have kept pump prices of and diesel unchanged post revision of duties by the state governments on Diwali eve.

Accordingly, and diesel prices remained static for the 14th consecutive day on Thursday under the daily price revision mechanism followed by oil marketing companies.

So, the pump price of in Delhi, which fell to Rs 103.97 a litre at 6 a.m. on the Diwali day on November 4 from the previous days' level of Rs 110.04 a litre, remained at the same level on Thursday. The diesel prices also remained unchanged in the capital at Rs 86.67 a litre.

In the financial capital Mumbai, petrol continued to be priced at Rs 109.98 a litre and diesel Rs 94.14 a litre.

Prices also remained static on Wednesday in Kolkata where the price of petrol reduced by Rs 5.82 to Rs 104.67 per litre and that of diesel by Rs 11.77 to Rs 89.79 per litre in the first week of November.

Petrol price in Chennai also remained at Rs 101.40 per litre and diesel Rs 91.43 per litre.

Across the country as well, the price of the fuel largely remained unchanged on Thursday but the retail rates varied depending on the level of local taxes.

The global crude prices, which has touched a three-year high level of over $85 a barrel on several occasions in the past one month, has softened now to below $ 80 barrel. Rise in the US inventory has pushed down crude prices, but OPEC+ decision on only gradual increase in production in December could raise crude prices further. This could put pressure on oil companies to revise upwards again.

Before price cuts and pause, diesel prices have increased 30 out of the last 55 days taking up its retail price by Rs 9.90 per litre in Delhi.

Petrol prices have also risen on 28 of the previous 51 days taking up its pump price by Rs 8.85 per litre.

Since January 1, 2021, petrol and diesel prices have risen by more than Rs 26 a litre before the duty cuts.

The excise duty cut by the Centre on November 3 was the first such exercise since the onset of Covid pandemic. In fact, the government had revised excise duty on petrol and diesel sharply in March and again in May last year to mobilise additional resources for Covid relief measures.

The excise duty was raised by Rs 13 and Rs 16 per litre on petrol and diesel between March 2020 and May 2020 and was standing high at Rs 31.8 on diesel and Rs 32.9 per litre on petrol before finally the Centre decided on duty cut.

“Now that the 12th meeting is approaching, a number of submissions are being made at the WTO for advancing negotiations in agriculture. India, along with the G-33 (group of nations), has been engaging in finding a permanent solution to the public stockholding issue,” one of the officials cited above said. India is hopeful of a positive outcome on public stockholding and domestic support, which are part of the negotiations.

It believes that the draft text on agriculture that was firmed up four months ago by a WTO panel is “completely imbalanced”. It felt this has dampened the prospects of any reasonable outcome on agriculture at the 12 ministerial conference and is not in favour of developing nations.

Finding a permanent solution to the public food stockpile issue is linked to the survival of 800 million hungry people across the globe.

Under the trade norms, a WTO member’s food subsidy bill should not breach the limit of 10 per cent of the value of production based on the reference price of 1986-88. Apprehending that full implementation of the programme may result in breach of the WTO cap, India has been seeking amendments in the formula to calculate the food subsidy cap.

As an interim measure, the WTO members, at the Bali ministerial meeting in December 2013, had agreed to put in place a mechanism popularly called the Peace Clause. They committed to negotiating an agreement for a permanent solution at the 11th ministerial meeting at Buenos Aires. Under the Peace Clause, WTO members agreed to refrain from challenging any breach in the prescribed ceiling by a developing nation at the dispute settlement forum of the WTO. This clause will be there till a permanent solution is found to the food stockpiling issue.

India had invoked the clause in 2018-19 (13 per cent) and 2019-20 (11 per cent) as it breached the subsidy cap for rice. The discourse in agriculture talks includes developed members asking developing countries to take on additional commitments in terms of enhanced market access and reduction in policy space through reduced domestic support.

Another issue under discussion is related to additional disciplines on export restrictions of agricultural products. Countries such as Japan, Cairns, G-10, European Union, the US, and Singapore are seeking outcomes on two issues. One is related to exemption of foodstuffs purchased for non-commercial humanitarian purposes by the World Food Programme. The other is advance notification of export restrictive measures. “Under the rules, WTO members can temporarily impose export restrictions to prevent critical shortages of food or other essential products to the country. India has raised concerns, saying this may be burdensome for developing countries,” the official said.

These have been distributed in four-five categories, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said. The government had asked banks to organise an outreach programme to lift demand during the festive season.

Banks visited districts and worked with non-banking financial companies to extend and their efforts on the ground have helped in reviving the Indian economy, she said.

Sitharaman said the banking sector has turned around remarkably as its non-performing assets have started declining along with higher recoveries. Public sector banks (PSBs) have raised Rs 10,000 crore from the market and are not looking at the government to fund them, she said.

PSBs’ profit in the first half of this financial year is nearly equal to that of the previous full financial year, the Ministry of Finance said.

Sustained recovery efforts have helped PSBs bring down their net NPA to 2.9 per cent for the quarter ended September, which has been the lowest in seven years, it said.

“Banks are recording remarkable progress in capital adequacy parameters, leading to increased lending power and engendering confidence in the financial soundness and stability by providing continued assurance to the depositors,” the ministry said in a tweet. PSBs’ capital to risk weighted asset ratio (CRAR) has risen from 11.7 per cent in March 2018 to 14.5 per cent in September 2021.

In its effort to further enable flow of credit across sectors, the government has organised a two-day conference from Wednesday for government departments, industry leaders, banks, and financial institutions to enable seamless credit flow to help the economy grow.

About 25 central ministries, industry representatives, and lenders are participating in the dialogue titled “Creating Synergies for Seamless Credit Flow and Economic Growth”.

PSB executives said the conference is for coordinated efforts to support investment and capital cycle, which is expected to be led by the government — central, states, and public sector entities — to spur private sector investment.

The focus has been to increase credit disbursement and tap retail demand. While this has shown encouraging results, the government has to include capital investment to ensure economic revival is durable, executives said.

At the forum, face-to-face interactions with secretaries will have a chance to seek help from banks to streamline the process for documentation and compliance work. The interaction would prove beneficial for the national infrastructure and asset monetisation pipelines, said a State Bank of India executive."

V Vaidyanathan, managing director and chief executive officer of IDFC First Bank, said the system in India has significant advantages like in the case of SBI with 200 years of existence and access across the length and breadth of the country. And now the digital features are helping to expand credit coverage further.

Google has a customer interface feature and the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a feature for mobile to mobile payment. This capability (combination) opens many more opportunities like selling insurance and mutual funds, he said, while participating in the session on challenges and opportunities for commercial

Swaminathan Janakiraman, managing director, SBI, said when you are in business, you face many challenges. There are two options: Either one keeps wondering about how that is going to be handled or finds ways to manage it. Banks have not exploited customer data for various reasons. Today, players like Google are in a position to provide a front-end and capture the imagination of digital natives.

The SBI has established digital capability of retail lending completely in the hand of consumers with just three clicks. The same is possible in the case of other financial services like investments. The bank has managed to stay relevant only because it has been able to innovate and join the bandwagon rather than be afraid of doing that, the SBI MD said.

Janmejaya Kumar Sinha, the chairman of Boston Consulting Group India, said the form of distribution of banks will have to evolve. They will have to be present in those marketplaces where the activity is. The biggest battle that is going on is the compression of time. Banks have to be nimble, he said.

The panellists grappled with whether big tech firms like Google could take away business from banks. On the lending and deposit rates likely to be set on these platforms, former Reserve Bank of India deputy governor N S Vishwanathan said such platforms can’t take deposits. They provide information about products like loans or insurance policies and their prices at one place and facilitate access. Hence, he doubted if these platforms were indeed taking business away from banks. In fact, he said, they are making competition much more open, which is good for customers."
